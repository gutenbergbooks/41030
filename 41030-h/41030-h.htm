<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This volume is devoted to two great
lines of pioneer movement, one
through northern Virginia and the
other through central New York. In the
former case the Old Northwestern Turnpike
is the key to the situation, and in the
latter the famous Genesee Road, running
westward from Utica, was of momentous
importance.</p>

<p>A chapter is given to the Northwestern
Turnpike, showing the movement which
demanded a highway, and the legislative
history which created it. Then follow two
chapters of travelers&rsquo; experiences in the
region covered. One of these is given to
the <i>Journal of Thomas Wallcutt</i> (1790)
through northern Virginia and central
Pennsylvania. Another chapter presents
no less vivid descriptions from quite unknown
travelers on the Virginian roads.</p>

<p>The Genesee Road is presented in chap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>ter
four as a legislative creation; the whole
history of this famous avenue would be
practically a history of central New York.
To give the more vivid impression of personal
experience a chapter is devoted to a
portion of Thomas Bigelow&rsquo;s <i>Tour to Niagara
Falls 1805</i> over the Genesee Road in
its earliest years, when the beautiful cities
which now lie like a string of precious
gems across this route were just springing
into existence. For a chapter on the important
&ldquo;Catskill Turnpike,&rdquo; which gives
much information of road-building in central
New York, we are indebted to Francis
Whiting Halsey&rsquo;s <i>The Old New York
Frontier</i>.</p>

<p>The final chapter of the volume includes
a number of selections from the spicy,
brilliant descriptions of pioneer traveling
in America which Dickens left in his
<i>American Notes</i>, and a few pages describing
an early journey on Indian trails in Missouri
from Charles Augustus Murray&rsquo;s
<i>Travels in North America</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE OLD NORTHWESTERN TURNPIKE</h3>


<p>We have treated of three historic
highways in this series of monographs
which found a way through
the Appalachian uplift into the Mississippi
Basin&mdash;Braddock&rsquo;s, Forbes&rsquo;s, and Boone&rsquo;s
roads and their successors. There were
other means of access into that region.
One, of which particular mention is to be
made in this volume, dodged the mountains
and ran around to the lakes by way of the
Mohawk River and the Genesee country.
Various minor routes passed westward from
the heads of the Susquehanna&mdash;one of
them becoming famous as a railway route,
but none becoming celebrated as roadways.
From central and southern Virginia, routes,
likewise to be followed by trunk railway
lines, led onward toward the Mississippi
Basin, but none, save only Boone&rsquo;s track,
became of prime importance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>But while scanning carefully this mountain
barrier, which for so long a period
held back civilization on the Atlantic seaboard,
there is found another route that
was historic and deserves mention as influencing
the westward movement of
America. It was that roadway so well
known three-fourths of a century ago as
the Old Northwestern Turnpike, leading
from Winchester, Virginia, to the Ohio
River at Parkersburg, Virginia, now West
Virginia, at the mouth of the Little
Kanawha.</p>

<p>The earliest history of this route is of far
more interest than importance, for the
subject takes us back once more to Washington&rsquo;s
early exploits and we feel again
the fever of his wide dreams of internal
communications which should make the
Virginia waterways the inlet and outlet of all
the trade of the rising West. It has been
elsewhere outlined how the Cumberland
Road was the actual resultant of Washington&rsquo;s
hopes and plans. But it is in place
in a sketch of the Old Northwestern Turnpike
to state that Washington&rsquo;s actual plan
of making the Potomac River all that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Erie Canal and the Cumberland Road
became was never even faintly realized.
His great object was attained&mdash;but not by
means of his partisan plans.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to catch the exact old-time
spirit of rivalry which existed among
the American colonies and which always
meant jealousy and sometimes bloodshed.
In the fight between Virginia officers in
Forbes&rsquo;s army in 1758 over the building of
a new road through Pennsylvania to Fort
Duquesne, instead of following Braddock&rsquo;s
old road, is an historic example of this
intense rivalry. A noted example, more
easily explained, was the conflict and
perennial quarrel between the Connecticut
and Pennsylvania pioneers within the
western extremity of the former colony&rsquo;s
technical boundaries. That Washington
was a Virginian is made very plain in a
thousand instances in his life; and many
times it is emphasized in such a way as
must seem odd to all modern Americans.
At a stroke of a pen he shows himself to
be the broadest of Americans in his classic
Letter to Benjamin Harrison, 1784; in the
next sentence he is urging Virginia to look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
well to her laurels lest New York, through
the Hudson and Mohawk, and Pennsylvania,
through the Susquehanna and
Juniata, do what Virginia ought to do
through her Potomac.</p>

<p>The powerful appeal made in this letter
was the result of a journey of Washington&rsquo;s
in the West which has not received all the
attention from historians it perhaps deserves.
This was a tour made in 1784 in
the tangled mountainous region between
the heads of the branches of the Potomac
and those of the Monongahela.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Starting
on his journey September 1, Washington
intended visiting his western lands and returning
home by way of the Great Kanawha
and New Rivers, in order to view the connection
which could be made there between
the James and Great Kanawha Valleys.
Indian hostilities, however, made it unwise
for him to proceed even to the Great
Kanawha, and the month was spent in
northwestern Virginia.</p>

<p>On the second, Washington reached
Leesburg, and on the third, Berkeley;
here, at his brother&rsquo;s (Colonel Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Washington&rsquo;s) he met a number of persons
including General Morgan. &ldquo;... one
object of my journey being,&rdquo; his <i>Journal</i>
reads, &ldquo;to obtain information of the nearest
and best communication between the
Eastern &amp; Western Waters; &amp; to facilitate
as much as in me lay the Inland Navigation
of the Potomack; I conversed a good deal
with Gen<sup>l</sup>. Morgan on this subject, who
said, a plan was in contemplation to extend
a Road from Winchester to the
Western Waters, to avoid if possible an
interference with any other State.&rdquo; It is
to be observed that this was a polite way of
saying that the road in contemplation must
be wholly in Virginia, which was the only
state to be &ldquo;interfered&rdquo; with or be benefited.
&ldquo;But I could not discover,&rdquo; Washington
adds, &ldquo;that Either himself, or
others, were able to point it out with precision.
He [Morgan] seemed to have no
doubt but that the Counties of Freder<sup>k</sup>.,
Berkeley &amp; Hampshire would contribute
freely towards the extension of the Navigation
of Potomack; as well as towards
opening a Road from East to West.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It should be observed that the only route<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
across the mountains from northwestern
Virginia to the Ohio River was Braddock&rsquo;s
Road; for this road Washington was a
champion in 1758, as against the central
route Forbes built straight west from
Bedford to Fort Duquesne.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Then, however,
Braddock&rsquo;s Road, and even Fort
Duquesne, was supposed to lie in Virginia.
But when the Pennsylvania boundaries
were fully outlined it was found that Braddock&rsquo;s
Road lay in Pennsylvania. Washington
now was seeking a new route to the
West which would lie wholly in Virginia.
The problem, historically, presents several
interesting points which cannot be expanded
here. Suffice it to say that Washington
was the valiant champion of Braddock&rsquo;s
Road until he found it lay wholly
in Maryland and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Gaining no satisfaction from his friends
at Berkeley, Washington pushed on to one
Captain Stroad&rsquo;s, out fourteen odd miles
on the road to Bath. &ldquo;I held much conversation
with him,&rdquo; the traveler records
of his visit at Stroad&rsquo;s, &ldquo;the result ...
was,&mdash;that there are two Glades which go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
under the denomination of the Great
glades&mdash;one, on the Waters of Yohiogany,
the other on those of Cheat River; &amp;
distinguished by the name of the Sandy
Creek Glades.&mdash;that the Road to the first
goes by the head of Patterson&rsquo;s Creek<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;that
from the acc<sup>ts</sup>. he has had of it, it is
rough; the distance he knows not.&mdash;that
there is a way to the Sandy Creek Glades
from the great crossing of Yohiogany
(or Braddocks Road) [Smithfield, Pennsylvania]
&amp; a very good one; ...&rdquo; At
the town of Bath Washington met one
Colonel Bruce who had traversed the
country between the North Branch (as
that tributary of the Potomac was widely
known) and the Monongahela. &ldquo;From
Col<sup>o</sup>. Bruce ... I was informed that
he had travelled from the North Branch of
Potomack to the Waters of Yaughiogany,
and Monongahela&mdash;that the Potom<sup>k</sup>. where
it may be made Navigable&mdash;for instance
where McCulloughs path crosses it, 40<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Miles above the old fort [Cumberland], is
but about 6 Miles to a pretty large branch
of the Yohiogany ...&mdash;that the Waters
of Sandy Creek which is a branch of cheat
River, which is a branch of Monongahela,
interlocks with these; and the Country
between, flat&mdash;that he thinks (in order to
ev<sup>d</sup>. [evade] passing through the State of
Pennsylvania) this would be an eligible
Road using the ten Miles C<sup>k</sup>. with a portage
to the Navigable Waters of the little
Kanhawa; ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the basis of Washington&rsquo;s plan
of internal communication from Potomac;
he now pressed forward to find if it were
possible to connect the Youghiogheny and
North Branch of the Potomac, the Youghiogheny
and Monongahela, and the Monongahela
and Little Kanawha. Of course the
plan was impossible, but the patient man
floundered on through the foothills and
mountains over what was approximately
the course mentioned, the &ldquo;McCullough&rsquo;s
Path&rdquo; and Sandy Creek route from the Potomac
to the Monongahela. In his explorations
he found and traversed one of the
earliest routes westward through this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
broken country immediately south of the
well known resorts, Oakland and Deer
Park, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railway.
This was the &ldquo;McCullough&rsquo;s&rdquo; Path already
mentioned. Having ascended the Monongahela
River from near Brownsville, Pennsylvania,
Washington, on September 24,
arrived at a surveyor&rsquo;s office (the home
of one Pierpoint) eight miles southward
along the dividing ridge between the
Monongahela and Cheat Rivers.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> On the
twenty-fifth&mdash;after a meeting with various
inhabitants of the vicinity&mdash;he went plunging
eastward toward the North Branch of
the Potomac &ldquo;along the New Road [which
intersected Braddock&rsquo;s Road east of Winding
Ridge] to Sandy Creek; &amp; thence by
McCullochs path to Logstons [on the North
Branch of the Potomac] and accordingly
set of [off] before Sunrise. Within 3 Miles
I came to the river Cheat ab<sup>t</sup>. 7 Miles
from its Mouth&mdash;.... The Road from
Morgan Town or Monongahela C<sup>t</sup>. House,
is said to be good to this ferry [Ice&rsquo;s]&mdash;distance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>ab<sup>t</sup>. 6 Miles<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ... from the
ferry the Laurel Hill<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> is assended ...
along the top of it the Road continues....
After crossing this hill the
road is very good to the ford of Sandy
Creek at one James Spurgeons,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> ...
ab<sup>t</sup>. 15 Miles from Ice&rsquo;s ferry. At the
crossing of this Creek McCullocks path,
which owes its origen to Buffaloes, being
no other than their tracks from one lick
to another &amp; consequently crooked &amp; not
well chosen, strikes off from the New
Road.... From Spurgeon&rsquo;s to one
Lemons, which is a little to the right of
McCullochs path, is reckoned 9 Miles, and
the way not bad; but from Lemons to the
entrance of the Yohiogany glades<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which is
estimated 9 Miles more thro&rsquo; a deep rich
Soil ... and what is called the briery
Mountain.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> ... At the entrance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the above glades I lodged this night, with
no other shelter or cover than my cloak. &amp;
was unlucky enough to have a heavy shower
of Rain.... 26<sup>th</sup>.... passing
along a small path ... loaded with
Water ... we had an uncomfortable
travel to one Charles friends<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> about 10
Miles.... A Mile before I came to
Friends, I crossed the great Branch of
Yohiogany.... Friend ... is
a great Hunter.... From Friends
I passed by a spring (distant 3 Miles) called
Archy&rsquo;s from a Man of that name&mdash;crossed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the backbone<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> &amp; descended into Ryans
glade.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;Thence by Tho<sup>s</sup>. Logston&rsquo;s ... to
the foot of the backbone, about 5 Miles ...
across the Ridge to Ryans glade one mile
and half ...&mdash;to Joseph Logstons 1&frac12;
Miles ...&mdash;to the N<sup>o</sup>. Branch at
McCullochs path 2 Miles<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;infamous
road&mdash;and to Tho<sup>s</sup>. Logstons 4 more....
27th. I left M<sup>r</sup>. Logston&rsquo;s ...&mdash;at ten
Miles I had ... gained the summit
of the Alligany Mountain<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and began to
desend it where it is very steep and bad to
the Waters of Pattersons Creek ...
along the heads of these [tributaries], &amp;
crossing the Main [Patterson&rsquo;s] Creek <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&amp;
Mountain bearing the same name<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> (on the
top of which at one Snails I dined) I came
to Col<sup>o</sup>. Abrah<sup>m</sup>. Hites at Fort pleasant on
the South Branch<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> about 35 Miles from
Logstons a little before the Suns setting.
My intention, when I set out from Logstons,
was to take the Road to Rumney
[Romney] by one Parkers but learning from
my guide (Joseph Logston) when I came
to the parting paths at the foot of the Alligany<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
(ab<sup>t</sup>. 12 Miles) that it was very little
further to go by Fort pleasant, I resolved
to take that Rout ... to get information....&rdquo;</p>

<p>This extract from Washington&rsquo;s journal
gives us the most complete information
obtainable of a region of country concern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>ing
which it is difficult to secure even
present-day information. The drift of the
pioneer tide had been on north and south
lines here; the first-comers into these
mountains wandered up the Monongahela
and Youghiogheny Rivers and their tributaries.
Even as early as the Old French
War a few bold companies of men had
sifted into the dark valleys of the Cheat
and Youghiogheny.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> That it was a difficult
country to reach is proved by the fact
that certain early adventurers in this region
were deserters from Fort Pitt. They were
safe here! A similar movement up the
two branches of the Potomac had created a
number of settlements there&mdash;far up where
the waters ran clear and swift amid the
mountain fogs. But there had been less
communication on east and west lines. It
is easy to assume that McCulloch&rsquo;s path
was the most important route across the
ragged ridges, from one glade and valley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
to another. It is entirely probable that
the New Road, to which Washington
refers, was built for some distance on the
buffalo trace which (though the earlier
route) branched from the New Road. An
old path ran eastward from Dunkard&rsquo;s Bottom
of which Washington says: &ldquo;...
being ... discouraged ... from
attempting to return [to the Potomac] by
the way of Dunkars Bottom, as the path it
is said is very blind &amp; exceedingly grown
up with briers, I resolved to try the other
Rout, along the New Road ...&rdquo; as
quoted on page 21. The growth of such
towns as Cumberland and Morgantown
had made a demand for more northerly
routes. The whole road-building idea in
these parts in the last quarter of the eighteenth
century was to connect the towns
that were then springing into existence,
especially Morgantown and Clarksburg
with Cumberland. Washington&rsquo;s dream of
a connected waterway was, of course,
hopelessly chimerical, and after him no
one pushed the subject of a highway of
any kind between the East and the West
through Virginia. Washington&rsquo;s own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
plans materialized in the Potomac Navigation
Company, and his highway, that
should be a strong link in the chain of
Federal Union between the improved Potomac
and the Ohio, became the Cumberland
Road; and it ran just where he did
not care to see it&mdash;through Maryland and
Pennsylvania. Yet it accomplished his
first high purpose of welding the Union
together, and was a fruit of that patriotic
letter to Governor Harrison written a few
days after Washington pushed his way
through the wet paths of the Cheat and
Youghiogheny Valleys in 1784.</p>

<p>These first routes across the mountains
south of the Cumberland Road&mdash;in Virginia&mdash;were,
as noted, largely those of
wild beasts.  &ldquo;It has been observed before,&rdquo;
wrote Washington in recapitulation,
&ldquo;to what fortuitous circumstances the paths
of this Country owe their being, &amp; how
much the ways may be better chosen by a
proper investigation of it; ...&rdquo; In
many instances the new roads built hereabouts
in later days were shorter than the
earlier courses; however it remains true
here, as elsewhere, that the strategic geog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>raphical
positions were found by the buffalo
and Indian, and white men have followed
them there unwaveringly with turnpike
and railway.</p>

<p>When Washington crossed the North
Branch of the Potomac on the 26th of October,
1784 at &ldquo;McCullochs crossing,&rdquo; he
was on the track of what should be, a
generation later, the Virginian highway
across the Appalachian system into the
Ohio Basin. Oddly enough Virginia had
done everything, it may truthfully be said,
toward building Braddock&rsquo;s Road to the
Ohio in 1755, and, in 1758, had done as
much as any colony toward building
Forbes&rsquo;s Road. All told, Virginia had
accomplished more in the way of road-building
into the old Central West by 1760
than all other colonies put together. Yet,
as it turned out, not one inch of either of
these great thoroughfares lay in Virginia
territory when independence was secured
and the individual states began their struggle
for existence in those &ldquo;critical&rdquo; after-hours.
These buffalo paths through her
western mountains were her only routes;
they coursed through what was largely an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
uninhabited region, and which remains
such today. Yet it was inevitable that a
way should be hewn here through Virginia
to the Ohio; the call from the West, the
hosts of pioneers, the need of a state way
of communication, all these and more,
made it sure that a Virginia Turnpike
should cross the mountains.</p>

<p>Before that day arrived the Cumberland
Road was proposed, built, and completed,
not only to the Ohio River, but almost to
the western boundary of the state of Ohio;
its famous successor of another generation,
the Baltimore and Ohio Railway, was undertaken
in 1825. These movements stirred
northern Virginians to action and on the
twenty-seventh of February, 1827, the
General Assembly passed an act &ldquo;to incorporate
the North-western Road Company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sections 1, 3, 4, and 5 of this Act are as
follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;1. &nbsp; <i>Be it enacted by the General Assembly
of Virginia</i>, That books shall be opened at
the town of Winchester, in Frederick
county, under the direction of Josiah Lockhart,
William Wood, George S. Lane,
Abraham Miller, and Charles Brent, or any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
two of them; at Romney, in Hampshire
county, under the direction of William
Naylor, William Donaldson, John M&rsquo;Dowell,
Robert Sherrard, and Thomas Slane,
or any two of them; at Moorfield, in Hardy
county, under the direction of Isaac Van
Meter, Daniel M&rsquo;Neil, Benjamin Fawcett,
Samuel M&rsquo;Machen, and John G. Harness,
or any two of them; at Beverly, in Randolph
county, under the direction of Eli
Butcher, Squire Bosworth, Jonas Crane,
Andrew Crawford, and William Cooper, or
any two of them; at Kingwood, in Preston
county, under the direction of William
Sigler, William Johnson, William Price,
Charles Byrne, and Thomas Brown, or any
two of them; at Pruntytown, in Harrison
county, under the direction of Abraham
Smith, Frederick Burdett, Thomas Gethrop,
Cornelius Reynolds, and Stephen Neill, or
any two of them; at Clarksburg, in Harrison
county, under the direction of John L.
Sehon, John Sommerville, John Webster,
Jacob Stealy, and Phineas Chapin, or any
two of them; and at Parkersburg, in Wood
county, under the direction of Jonas Beason,
Joseph Tomlinson, Tillinghast Cook, James<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
H. Neal, and Abraham Samuels, or any
two of them, for purpose of receiving subscriptions
to a capital stock of seventy-five
thousand dollars, in shares of twenty dollars,
to be appropriated to the making of a
road from Winchester to some proper place
on the Ohio river, between the mouths
of Muskingum, and Little Kanawha
rivers, according to the provisions of this
act....</p>

<p>&ldquo;3. &nbsp; The proceedings of the first general
meeting of the stockholders, shall be
preserved with subsequent proceedings of
the company, all of which shall be entered
of record in well bound books to be kept
for that purpose: And from and after the
first appointment of directors, the said responsible
subscribers, their heirs and assigns,
shall be, and they are hereby declared
to be, a body politic and corporate, by the
name of &lsquo;The North western Road Company;&rsquo;...</p>

<p>&ldquo;4. &nbsp; It shall be the duty of the Principal
Engineer of the State, as soon as existing
engagements will permit, to prescribe
such plans or schemes for making the
whole road, or the several parts or sections<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
thereof, as he shall think best calculated
to further its most proper and speedy completion,
and to locate and graduate the
same, or part or parts thereof, from time to
time, make estimates of the probable cost
of making each five miles, (or any shorter
sections,) so located and graduated, and to
make report thereof to the Board of Public
Works at such time or times as shall be
convenient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;5. &nbsp; The said president and directors
shall, from time to time, make all contracts
necessary for the completion of the said
road, and shall require from subscribers
equal advances and payments on their
shares, and they shall have power to compel
payments by the sale of delinquent
shares, in such a manner as shall be prescribed
by their by-laws, and transfer the
same to purchasers: <i>Provided</i>, That if any
subscriber shall at any time be a contractor
for making any part of the said road, or in
any other manner become a creditor of the
company, he shall be entitled to a proper
set-off in the payment of his stock, or any
requisition made thereon....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>A mistake which doomed these plans to
failure was in arbitrarily outlining a road
by way of the important towns without due
consideration of the nature of the country
between them. The mountains were not
to be thus mocked; even the buffalo had
not found an east and west path here easily.
As noted, the towns where subscriptions
were opened were Winchester, Romney,
Moorefield, Beverly, Kingwood, Pruntytown,
Clarksburg, and Parkersburg. When
the engineers got through Hampshire
County by way of Mill Creek Gap in Mill
Creek Mountain and on into Preston County,
insurmountable obstacles were encountered
and it was reported that the road would
never reach Kingwood. From that moment
the North-western Road Company stock
began to languish; only the intervention
of the state saved the enterprise. However,
in 1831, a new and very remarkable
act was passed by the Virginia Assembly
organizing a road company that stands
unique in a road-building age. This was
&ldquo;An act to provide for the construction of
a turnpike road from Winchester to some
point on the Ohio river.&rdquo; The governor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
was made president of the company and he
with the treasurer, attorney-general, and
second auditor constituted the board of
directors. The 1st, 2d, and 4th sections of
this interesting law are as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;1. &nbsp; <i>Be it enacted by the general assembly</i>, &nbsp;
That the governor, treasurer, attorney
general, and second auditor of the commonwealth
for the time being, and their
successors, are hereby constituted a body
politic and corporate, under the denomination
of &lsquo;The President and Directors of the
North-Western Turnpike Road,&rsquo; with
power to sue and be sued, plead and be
impleaded, and to hold lands and tenements,
goods and chattels, and the same to
sell, dispose of, or improve, in trust for the
commonwealth, for the purposes hereinafter
mentioned. And three of the
said commissioners shall constitute a board
for the transaction of such business as is
hereby entrusted to them; of which board,
when present, the governor shall be president:
And they shall have power to appoint
a clerk from without their own body,
and make such distribution of their duties
among themselves respectively, and such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
rules and regulations ... as to them
may seem necessary....</p>

<p>&ldquo;2. &nbsp; <i>Be it further enacted</i>, &nbsp; That the said
president and directors of the North-Western
turnpike road be, and they are hereby
empowered as soon as may be necessary for
the purposes herein declared, to borrow on
the credit of the state, a sum or sums of
money not exceeding one hundred and
twenty-five thousand dollars, and at a rate
of interest not exceeding six per centum
per annum....</p>

<p>&ldquo;4. &nbsp; <i>Be it further enacted</i>, &nbsp; That the said
president and directors, out of the money
hereby authorized to be borrowed, shall
cause to be constructed a road from the
town of Winchester, in the county of Frederick,
to some point on the Ohio river, to
be selected by the principal engineer.
And for the purpose aforesaid, the principal
engineer, as soon as may be after the
passage of this act, shall proceed to lay out
and locate the said road from the points
above designated. He shall graduate the
said road in such manner that the acclivity
or declivity thereof shall in no case exceed
five degrees. The width of the said road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
may be varied, so that it shall not exceed
eighteen feet, nor be less than twelve feet.
Through level ground it shall be raised in
the middle one-twenty-fourth part of its
breadth, but in passing along declivities it
may be flat. Bridges, side ditches, gutters,
and an artificial bed of stone or gravel,
shall be dispensed with, except in such
instances as the said principal engineer
may deem them necessary....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Other sections stipulated that the state
had the right to survey any and all routes
the engineers desired to examine, and that
persons suffering by loss of land or otherwise
could, if proper application was made
within one year, secure justice in the
superior or county courts; that the company
appoint a superintendent who should
have in charge the letting of contracts after
such were approved by the company; that,
as each stretch of twenty miles was completed,
toll gates could be erected thereon,
where usual tolls could be collected by the
company&rsquo;s agents, the total sum collected
to be paid into the state treasury; that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
company had the right to erect bridges,
or in case a ferry was in operation, to make
the ferryman keep his banks and boats in
good condition; that the company make
annual reports to the State Board of Public
Works; and that the road be forever a
public highway.</p>

<p>The roadway was now soon built. Not
dependent upon the stock that might be
taken in the larger towns, the road made
peace with the mountains and was built
through the southern part of Preston
County in 1832, leaving Kingwood some
miles to the north. Evansville was located
in 1833, and owes its rise to the great
road. The route of the road is through
Hampshire, Mineral, Grant, Garrett, Preston,
Taylor, Harrison, Doddridge, Ritchie,
and Wood Counties, all West Virginia save
Garrett which is in Maryland. Important
as the route became to the rough, beautiful
country which it crossed, it never became
of national importance. Being started so
late in the century, the Baltimore and Ohio
Railway, which was completed to Cumberland
in 1845, stopped in large part the busy
scenes of the Old Northwestern Turnpike.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet to the historic inquirer the old turnpike,
so long forgotten by the outside
world, lies where it was built; and can
fairly be said to be a monument of the last
of those stirring days when Virginia
planned to hold the West in fee. Hundreds
of residents along this road recall
the old days with intense delight. True,
the vast amount of money spent on the
Cumberland Road was not spent on its less
renowned rival to the south, but the Cumberland
Road was given over to the states
through which it ran; and, in many instances,
was so neglected that it was as
poor a road as some of its less pretentious
rivals. A great deal of business of a national
character was done on the Northwestern
Turnpike. Parkersburg became
one of the important entrep&ocirc;ts in the Ohio
Valley; as early as 1796, we shall soon see,
a pioneer traversing the country through
which the Northwestern Turnpike&rsquo;s predecessor
coursed, speaks of an awakening in
the Monongahela Valley that cannot be
considered less than marvelous. Taking
it through the years, few roads have remained
of such constant benefit to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
territory into which they ran, and today
you will be told that no railway has benefited
that mountainous district so much as
this great thoroughfare.</p>

<p>But in a larger sense than any merely
local one, Virginia counted on the Northwestern
Turnpike to bind the state and
connect its eastern metropolis with the
great Ohio Valley. Virginia had given
up, on demand, her great county of Kentucky
when the wisdom of that movement
was plain; at the call of the Nation, she
had surrendered the title her soldiers had
given her to Illinois and the beautifully
fertile Scioto Valley in Ohio. But after
these great cessions she did not lose the
rich Monongahela country. It had been
explored by her adventurers, settled by
her pioneers&mdash;and Virginia held dear to
her heart her possessions along the upper
Ohio. In the days when the Northwestern
Turnpike was created by legislative act,
canals were not an assured success, and
railways were only being dreamed of.
And the promoters of canals and railways
were considered insane when they hinted
that the mountains could be conquered by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
these means of transportation. With all
the vast need for improvements, the genius
of mankind had never created anything
better than the road and the cart; what
hope was there that now suddenly America
should surprise the world by overthrowing
the axioms of the centuries past?</p>

<p>And so, in the correct historical analysis,
the Northwestern Turnpike must be considered
Virginia&rsquo;s attempt to compete successfully
with Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
New York, in securing for herself a commanding
portion of the trade of the West.
In all the legislative history of the origin
of the Northwestern Turnpike, it is continually
clear that its origin was of more
than local character. It was actually the
last roadway built from the seaboard to
the West in the hope of securing commercial
superiority; and its decline and decay
marks the end of pioneer road-building
across the first great American &ldquo;divide.&rdquo;
In a moment the completion of the Erie
Canal assured the nation that freight could
be transported for long distances at one-tenth
the cost that had prevailed on the
old land highways. Soon after, the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>pletion
of the Pennsylvania Canal proved
that the canal could successfully mount
great heights&mdash;and Virginia forgot her
roads in her interest in canals.</p>

<h3>A JOURNEY IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA</h3>


<p>Thomas Wallcutt of Massachusetts
served through the Revolutionary
War as hospital steward and
received in payment therefor one share in
the Ohio Company.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He went out to
Marietta in 1790, and returned eastward by
the half-known Virginia route. His <i>Journal</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
forms an interesting chapter of travel
on American pioneer roads:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday, 8 March, 1790.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> &nbsp; Pleasant,
clear, cold, and high winds. We were up
before sunrise, and got some hot breakfast,
coffee and toast; and Captain Prince, Mr.
Moody, Mr. Skinner, Captain Mills and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
brother, Mr. Bent, &amp;c., accompanied us
over the river<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to Sargent&rsquo;s or Williams&rsquo;s,
and took leave of us about nine o&rsquo;clock,
and we proceeded on our journey. We
had gone but a little way when we found
the path<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> so blind that we could not proceed
with certainty, and I was obliged to
go back and get a young man to come and
show us the way. When we had got back
to our companions again, they had found
the road, and we walked twenty miles this
day. Weather raw, chilly, and a little
snow. The country after about five or six
miles from the Ohio is very broken and
uneven, with high and sharp hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tuesday, 9 March, 1790. &nbsp;  The weather
for the most part of the day pleasant, but
cold winds, northerly. The country very
rough, the hills high and sharp.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> One
third of the road must go over and on the
ridges, and another third through the val<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>leys.
We walked this day about twenty-three
or twenty-four miles, and slept near
the forty-fourth or forty-fifth mile tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wednesday, 10 March, 1790. &nbsp;  Weather
raw and moist. To-day we crossed several
of the large creeks and waters that fall into
the Ohio. This occasioned a loss of much
time, waiting for the horse to come over
for each one, which he did as regularly as
a man would. The country much the
same, but rather better to-day, except that
a great deal of the road runs along through
the streams, and down the streams such a
length with the many bridges that will be
wanted, that it will be a vast expense,
besides the risk and damage of being carried
away every year by the floods. We
had so much trouble in crossing these
streams that at last we forded on foot.
One of the largest in particular, after we
had rode it several times, we waded it four
or five times almost knee-deep, and after
that a number of times on logs, or otherwise,
without going in water. Two of the
streams, I doubt not, we crossed as often as
twenty times each. We walked this day
about fifteen miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thursday, 11 March, 1790. &nbsp;  With much
fatigue and pain in my left leg, we walked
about fifteen miles to-day. They all walked
better than I, and had got to Carpenter&rsquo;s
and had done their dinner about two
o&rsquo;clock when I arrived. They appear to be
good farmers and good livers, have a good
house, and seem very clever people. Mr.
C. is gone down the country. They have
been a frontier here for fifteen years, and
have several times been obliged to move
away. I got a dish of coffee and meat for
dinner, and paid ninepence each, for the
doctor and me. We set off, and crossed
the west branch of the Monongahela over
to Clarksburgh. The doctor paid his own
ferriage. We went to Major Robinson&rsquo;s,
and had tea and meat, &amp;c., for supper. I
paid ninepence each, for the doctor and me.
Weather dull and unpleasant, as yesterday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friday, 12 March, 1790. &nbsp;  Weather good
and pleasant to-day. We set off before
sunrise and got a little out of our road into
the Morgantown road, but soon got right
again. We breakfasted at Webb&rsquo;s mill, a
good house and clever folks. Had coffee,
meat, &amp;c.; paid sixpence each, for me and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the doctor. Lodged at Wickware&rsquo;s, who says
he is a Yankee, but is a very disagreeable
man for any country, rough and ugly, and
he is very dear. I paid one shilling apiece
for the doctor&rsquo;s and my supper, upon some
tea made of mountain birch, perhaps black
birch, stewed pumpkin, and sodden meat.
Appetite supplies all deficiencies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saturday, 13 March, 1790.  &nbsp; Beautiful
weather all day. Set off not so early this
morning as yesterday. The doctor paid his
ferriage himself. Mr. Moore, a traveller
toward his home in Dunker&rsquo;s Bottom, Fayette
County, Pennsylvania, [?] set out with
us. He seems a very mild, good-natured,
obliging old gentleman, and lent me his
horse to ride about two miles, while he
drove his pair of steers on foot. The doctor
and I being both excessively fatigued,
he with a pain in his knee, and mine in my
left leg, but shifting about, were unable to
keep up with our company, and fell much
behind them. Met Mr. Carpenter on his
return home. He appears to be a very
clever man. When we had come to Field&rsquo;s,
I found Mr. Dodge had left his horse for
us to ride, and to help us along, which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
could not have done without. We got a
dish of tea without milk, some dried
smoked meat and hominy for dinner; and
from about three o&rsquo;clock to nine at night,
got to Ramsay&rsquo;s. Seven miles of our way
were through a new blazed path where
they propose to cut a new road. We got
out of this in good season, at sundown or
before dark, into the wagon road, and
forded Cheat River on our horses. Tea,
meat, &amp;c., for supper. Old Simpson and
Horton, a constable, had a terrible scuffle
here this evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Day, 14 March, 1790. &nbsp;  Mr.
Dodge is hurrying to go away again. I
tell him I must rest to-day. I have not
written anything worth mention in my
journal since I set out, until to-day, and so
must do it from memory. I want to shave
a beard seven days old, and change a shirt
about a fortnight dirty; and my fatigue
makes rest absolutely necessary. So take
my rest this day, whether he has a mind to
go or stay with us. Eat very hearty of
hominy or boiled corn with milk for breakfast,
and boiled smoked beef and pork for
dinner, with turnips. After dinner shaved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and shirted me, which took till near night,
it being a dark house, without a bit of window,
as indeed there is scarce a house on
this road that has any.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday, 15 March, 1790. &nbsp;  Waited and
got some tea for breakfast, before we set
out. Settled with Ramsay, and paid him
9<i>d.</i> per meal, for five meals, and half-pint
whiskey 6<i>d.</i> The whole came to eight
shillings. Weather very pleasant most of
the day. We walked to Brien&rsquo;s about half-past
six o&rsquo;clock, which they call twenty-four
miles. We eat a little fried salt pork
and bit of venison at Friends&rsquo;,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and then
crossed the great Youghiogeny. About
two miles further on, we crossed the little
<i>ditto</i> at Boyles&rsquo;s.... We walked
about or near an hour after dark, and were
very agreeably surprised to find ourselves
at Brien&rsquo;s instead of Stackpole&rsquo;s, which is
four miles further than we expected. Eat
a bit of Indian bread, and the woman gave
us each about half a pint of milk to drink,
which was all our supper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tuesday, 16 March, 1790. &nbsp;  We were
up this morning, and away about or before
sunrise, and ascended the backbone of the
Alleghany, and got breakfast at Williams&rsquo;s.
I cannot keep up with my company. It
took me till dark to get to Davis&rsquo;s. Messers.
Dodge and Proctor had gone on before us
about three miles to Dawson&rsquo;s. We got
some bread and butter and milk for supper,
and drank a quart of cider. Mr. Davis was
originally from Ashford, county of Windham,
Connecticut; has been many years
settled in this country; has married twice,
and got many children. His cider in a
brown mug seemed more like home than
any thing I have met with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wednesday, 17 March.  &nbsp; We were up
this morning before day, and were set off
before it was cleverly light. Got to Dawson&rsquo;s,
three miles, where Messers. D. &amp; P.
lodged, and got some tea for breakfast, and
set off in good season, the doctor and I
falling behind. As it is very miry, fatiguing
walking, and rainy, which makes extremely
painful walking in the clay and mud, we
could not keep up with D. We stopped
about a mile and a half from the Methodist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
meeting near the cross roads at Cressops,
and four from Cumberland, and got some
fried meat and eggs, milk, butter, &amp;c.,
for dinner, which was a half pistareen
each. After dinner the doctor and I walked
into Cumberland village about three o&rsquo;clock,
and put up at Herman Stitcher&rsquo;s or Stidger&rsquo;s.
We called for two mugs of cider,
and got tea, bread and butter, and a boiled
leg of fresh young pork for supper. The
upper part of the county of Washington
has lately been made a separate county,
and called Alleghany, as it extends over
part of that mountain, and reaches to the
extreme boundary of Maryland. The
courts, it is expected, will be fixed and
held at this place, Cumberland, which will
probably increase its growth, as it thrives
pretty fast already. We supped and breakfasted
here; paid 2<i>s.</i> for each, the doctor
and me. Pleasant fine weather this day.
My feet exceedingly sore, aching, throbbing,
and beating. I cannot walk up with
my company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thursday, 18 March. &nbsp;  Paid Mr. Dodge
6<i>s.</i> advance. A very fine day. We stayed
and got breakfast at Stitcher&rsquo;s, and walked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
from about eight o&rsquo;clock to twelve, to Old
Town, and dined at Jacob&rsquo;s, and then
walked to Dakins&rsquo;s to lodge, where we got
a dish of Indian or some other home coffee,
with a fry of chicken and other meat for
supper. This is the first meal I have paid
a shilling L. M. for. The country very
much broken and hilly, sharp high ridges,
and a great deal of pine. About ...
miles from Old Town, the north and south
branches of the Potomac join. We walked
twenty-five miles to-day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friday, 19 March, 1790. &nbsp;  Very fine
weather again to-day. We walked twenty-four
miles to McFarren&rsquo;s in Hancock, and
arrived there, sun about half an hour high.
McFarren says this town has been settled
about ten or twelve years, and is called for
the man who laid it out or owned it, and
not after Governor Hancock. It is a small
but growing place of about twenty or thirty
houses, near the bank of the Potomac,
thirty-five miles below Old Town, and five
below Fort Cumberland; twenty-four above
Williamsport, and ninety-five above Georgetown.
We slept at McFarren&rsquo;s, a so-so
house. He insisted on our sleeping in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
beds, and would not permit sleeping on the
floors. We all put our feet in soak in warm
water this evening. It was recommended
to us by somebody on the road, and I think
they feel the better for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saturday, 20 March.  &nbsp; A very fine day
again. We have had remarkably fine
weather on this journey hitherto. But two
days we had any rain, and then but little.
We stayed and got breakfast at McFarren&rsquo;s,
and set out about eight o&rsquo;clock, and
walked about twenty-one miles this day to
Thompson&rsquo;s, about half a mile from
Buchanan&rsquo;s in the Cove Gap in the North
Mountain. My feet do not feel quite so
bad this day, as they have some days. I
expect they are growing stronger and fitter
for walking every day, though it has cost
me a great deal of pain, throbbing, beating,
and aching to bring them to it. It seems
the warm water last night did me some
good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Day, 21 March, 1790. &nbsp;  Up and
away before sunrise, and walked to breakfast
to McCracken&rsquo;s. He has been an
officer in the continental army. I find it
will not do for me to try any longer to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
up with my company, and as they propose
going through Reading, and we through
Philadelphia, we must part to-night or to-morrow.
I conclude to try another seven
miles, and if I cannot keep up, we part at
Semple&rsquo;s, the next stage. They got to Semple&rsquo;s
before me, and waited for me. I conclude
to stay and dine here, and part with
Messrs. Proctor and Dodge. I am so dirty;
my beard the ninth day old, and my shirt
the time worn, that I cannot with any
decency or comfort put off the cleaning any
longer. I again overhauled the letters, as
I had for security and care taken all into
my saddle-bags. I sorted them and gave
Mr. Dodge his, with what lay more direct
in his way to deliver, and took some from
him for Boston and my route.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I paid Mr. Dodge three shillings more
in addition to six shillings I had paid him
before at the Widow Carrel&rsquo;s, according to
our agreement at twelve shillings to Philadelphia;
and as we had gone together and
he had carried our packs three hundred
miles (wanting two), it was near the matter.
He supposed I should do right to give
him a shilling more. I told him as I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
agreed with him at the rate of fifty pounds,
when they did not weigh above thirty-five,
and at the rate of going up to Pitt instead
of returning, which is but half price, I
thought it was a generous price, and paid
him accordingly as by agreement. We
wished each other a good journey, and
Mr. Proctor, the doctor, and I drank a cup
of cider together. When we had got
cleaned, a wagoner came along very
luckily, and dined with us, and going our
way, we put our packs in his wagon, and
rode some to help. We gave him a quarter
of a dollar for this half day and tomorrow.
We got to Carlisle in the evening
and put up with Adam at Lutz&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Carlisle is said to be extremely
bad in wet weather. It probably is nearly
&amp; quite as bad as Pittsburg, Marietta,
Albany. I went to Lutz&rsquo;s because Adam
puts up there, he being of his nation, but
it is a miserable house, and Adam says he
is sorry he carried us there. The victuals
are good, but they are dirty, rough, impolite.
We supped on bread and milk, and
Lutz would insist on our sleeping in a bed
and not on the floor; so we did so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tuesday, 23 March, 1790. &nbsp;  A pleasant
day and the roads very much dried, so
that the travelling is now comfortable.
We dined at Callender&rsquo;s in more fashion
than since I left home. Adam stopped at
Simpson&rsquo;s so long that it was dark when we
got over the river to Chambers&rsquo;s, where we
stopped another half hour. Set off about
seven o&rsquo;clock, and got to Foot&rsquo;s about
eleven. All abed, but Adam got us a bit
of bread and butter, and made us a fire in
the stove, and we lay on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wednesday, 24 March, 1790. &nbsp;  Old Foot
is a crabbed.... He has been scolding
and swearing at Adam all this morning
about something that I cannot understand.
It has rained last night, and the roads are
again intolerable. Adam says he cannot
go again until his father says the word,
and that may not be this two or three days.
But we cannot go and carry our packs on
our backs now, the roads are so bad, and
we should gain nothing to walk, but spend
our strength to little or no purpose. We
must wait for a wagon to go along our
way, and join it, or wait for the roads to
grow better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Carried our dirty things to wash; two
shirts, two pairs stockings, and one handkerchief
for me; two shirts, two pair stockings,
and one pair trowsers for the doctor.
Went to several places to look for shoes for
the doctor. He could not fit himself at the
shoemakers, and bought a pair in a store
for 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Pennsylvania, or 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> our currency.
He went to Henry Moore&rsquo;s, the
sign of the two Highlanders. I drank a
quart of beer and dined. Old Foot is a
supervisor, and is gone to Harrisburg to-day,
to settle some of his business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thursday, 25 March, 1790. &nbsp;  The sun
rises and shines out so bright to-day that
I am in hopes the roads will be better, at
least, when we go. Old Foot could not
finish his business yesterday, and is gone
again to-day. He is uncertain when he
shall send Adam forward to Philadelphia,
perhaps not until Monday. It will not do
for us to stay, if we can somehow get along
sooner. Time hangs heavy on our hands,
but we do what we can to kill it. The
doctor and I went down to Moore&rsquo;s and
dined together, which was a shilling L. M.
apiece. We then came back to Foot&rsquo;s and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
drank a pint of cider-royal together. The
house is for the most part of the day filled
with Germans, who talk much, but we cannot
understand them. We have coffee and
toast, or meat for breakfast, and mush and
milk for supper. Our time is spent in the
most irksome manner possible; eating and
drinking, and sleeping and yawning, and
attending to the conversation of these
Dutch. In the evening the house is
crowded with the neighbors, &amp;c., and for
the ... Old Foot says, and Adam too,
that he will not go till Monday. This is
very discouraging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friday, 26 March, 1790. &nbsp;  A very dull
prospect to-day. It rained very hard in
the night, and continues to rain this morning.
No wagons are passing, and none
coming that we can hear of. We have no
prospect now but to stay and go with
Adam on Monday. We stay at home
to-day and murder our time. We read
McFingal, or Ballads, or whatever we can
pick up. We had coffee and toast and fresh
fried veal for breakfast, and ate heartily,
and so we eat no dinner. The doctor
goes out and buys us 8<i>d.</i> worth of cakes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and we get a half-pint of whiskey, which
makes us a little less sad. In comes a man
to inquire news, &amp;c., of two men from
Muskingum. He had heard Thompson&rsquo;s
report, which had made so much noise and
disquiet all through the country. He had
three Harrisburg papers with him, which
give us a little relief in our dull and unwelcome
situation. At dark there come in
two men with a wagon and want lodging,
&amp;c. They stay this night, and with them
we find an opportunity of going forward
as far as Lancaster, which we are determined
to embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saturday, 27 March, 1790. &nbsp;  We stay
and get a good breakfast before we set out,
and agree to give Mr. Bailey 2<i>s.</i> L. M. for
carrying our baggage. This is higher than
anything it has cost us on the road in proportion,
but we cannot help it. It is better
than to waste so much time in a tavern. It
rains steadily, and the road is all mush and
water. Before I get on a hundred rods I
am half-leg deep in mire. Set off about
eight o&rsquo;clock, and overtook the wagon
about two miles ahead. However, it clears
off before night, and the sun shines warm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and the roads mend fast. We made a stay
in Elizabethtown about two hours to feed
and rest. The doctor and I had two quarts
of beer and some gingerbread and buckwheat
cakes for dinner. We got to Colonel
Pedens to lodge, which is eighteen miles
through an intolerable bad road, to-day.
(Elizabethtown, about fifty houses; Middletown,
about an hundred houses.) We paid
our landlady this evening, as we are to
start so early in the morning it would not
do to wait till the usual time of getting up
to pay then, and we have got nine miles to
go to reach Lancaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Day, 28 March, 1790. &nbsp;  We
started this morning at day dawn, and got
to &mdash;&mdash; at the Black Horse, four and a half
miles to breakfast. The wagon went by
us, and fed at Shoop&rsquo;s. I left the doctor
with them and to take care of the things,
and walked into the town before them.
Stopped at Gross&rsquo;s, the Spread Eagle, and
left word for the doctor, which they never
told him. I heard the bell ring for church
just as I got here, which made me go into
town after waiting some time for them.
Took leave of Mr. Bailey, &amp;c. I went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the English Episcopal Church, and then
went back to look for the doctor, and he
looking for me; we were some time in
chase, and missed each other. Found we
could not get served at the Angel, so took
our baggage and walked down to Doersh&rsquo;s,
who keeps the stage. Got dinner here.
Shaved, shirted, put on my boots, and went
out into town. Stopped at the court-house
and heard a Methodist. Walked further
about; stopped and looked into the Catholic
chapel, and talked with the priest.
Looked into the churches, such as I could,
and returned to tea at sundown. Spent
the remainder of the time till bed reading
newspapers. Washed my feet and went to
bed just before ten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday, 29 March, 1790. &nbsp;  After breakfast
the doctor and I took a ramble about
the town, to look at it and to inquire if we
could find any wagon going to Philadelphia,
that we can get our baggage carried.
The most likely place we can hear of is to
go to the Creek, about a mile from town.
Immediately after our walk we settled and
paid, and set out at just eleven o&rsquo;clock.
Paid toll over Conestoga bridge, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
stopped at Locher&rsquo;s, at the Indian King,
two miles from Lancaster, and drank a
quart of beer. It was not good. Dined
at Blesser&rsquo;s, on a cold meal, which was 8<i>d.</i>
L. M. apiece. Got to Hamilton&rsquo;s at Salsbury,
a very good house; nineteen miles.
This is more than I expected when I set
out at eleven o&rsquo;clock. A very good supper;
rye mush and milk, cold corn beef,
and apple pie on the table. But 8<i>d.</i> L. M.
for supper and lodging apiece. We have
had very good weather for travelling, and
the roads are drying fast. In hopes that
we shall find some wagon going on the
Philadelphia road, that we may get our
packs carried part of the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tuesday, 30 March, 1790. &nbsp;  We walked
twenty-four miles this day, that is, from
Hamilton&rsquo;s to Fahnstock&rsquo;s. Very pleasant
weather, suitable for travelling; not too
warm nor too cold. My feet very tender
and sore, but we keep along steady. Got
to Fahnstock&rsquo;s, Admiral Warren, about
eight o&rsquo;clock. Got some bread and milk
for supper. The doctor had nothing but
a pint of cider for his supper. We slept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
well, considering my being excessively
fatigued. The post overtook us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wednesday, 31 March.  &nbsp; Stayed to
breakfast this morning, which was very
good, but I do not like the practice, at
least I do not seem to need eating meat
with breakfast every morning. I sometimes
eat it two or three times a day because
it is set before me, and it is the fashion to
have meat always on the table. We dined
about seven miles from Philadelphia;
crossed the Schuylkill about sunset, and
walked into town about dark. Crossed the
Schuylkill over the floating bridge, and
paid our toll, 1<i>d.</i> Pennsylvania each.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>A PILGRIM ON BRADDOCK&rsquo;S ROAD</h3>


<p>A yellow letter, almost in tatters,
lies before me written by one
Samuel Allen to his father, Mr.
Jason Allen of Montville, New London
County, Connecticut, from Bellville, Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
November 15, 1796. Bellville is in
Wood County, West Virginia, eighteen
miles by the Ohio River from Parkersburg.</p>

<p>This letter, describing a journey from
Alexandria and Cumberland to the Ohio
by way of &ldquo;broadaggs [Braddock&rsquo;s] old
road,&rdquo; gives a picture of certain of the
more pathetic phases of the typical emigrant&rsquo;s
experience unequaled by any account
we have met in print. Incidentally,
there is included a mention of the condition
of the road and, what is of more interest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
a clear glimpse into the Ohio Valley when
the great rush of pioneers had begun after
the signing of the Treaty of Greenville,
the year before, which ended the Indian
War.</p>

was in hopes of recieving a letter by him.
but his brother was here the other day and
sayes that he left his trunk and left the letters
that he had in the trunk, so I am still
in hopes of having one yet. There is an
opertunity of sending letters once every

to carry the goods across the mountains to
Morgantown on the Monongahaly about
one hundred miles above Pittsburg Mr
Avorys expence in comeing was from N

<p>&ldquo;We then proceeded on our journey &amp;
we soon overtook the waggons &amp; that nite
we got to the foot of the mountain We
came to this mountain on the 11<sup>th</sup> of the
month and got over it the 19<sup>th</sup> at night
We left the city of Allexandria on the

Morgantown on the Monongahely the 18<sup>th</sup>

<p>&ldquo;When we arrived at Morgantown the
river was so lo that boats could not go
down but it began to rain the same day
that I got ther I was about one mile from
there when it began to rain &amp; from the
22<sup>d</sup> at night to the 23<sup>d</sup> in the morning it
raised 16 feet the logs came down the

<p>&ldquo;Mr Avory said while he was at Morgantown
that Cattle were verry high down the
river &amp; them that wanted to by he
thought had better by then he purchased
some &amp; I bought two cows and three
calvs for myself &amp; three cows for Mrs
Hemsted &amp; calves &amp; a yoke of three year
old stears. The next morning after the
Boats sailed I set off by land with the cattle
&amp; horses with John Turner &amp; Jonathan
Prentice &amp; arrived at Bellvill the 9<sup>th</sup> of
August &amp; found it to be a verry rich &amp;
pleasant country We came to the Ohio
at Wheeling crick one hundred miles belo
Pittsburg &amp; about the same from Morgantown
We found the country settled the
hole of the way from Morgantown to
Wheeling &amp; a verry pleasant road we saw
some verry large &amp; beautiful plantations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
here I saw richer land than I ever saw
before large fields of corn &amp; grane of a
stout groath From Wheeling to Bellville
it is a wilderness for the most of the way
except the banks of the river this side &mdash;&mdash; which
is one hundred miles we found
it verry difficult to get victules to eat. I
drove fifty miles with one meal of victules
through the wilderness &amp; only a foot path
&amp; that was so blind that we was pestered
to keep it we could drive but a little
wayes in a day whenever night overtook
us we would take our blankets &amp; wrap
around us &amp; ly down on the ground We
found some inhabitance along the river
but they came on last spring &amp; had no
provisions only what they brought with
them</p>

<p>&ldquo;The country is as good as it was represented

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following is a translation of a letter
written twelve years after Washington&rsquo;s
journey of 1784, by Eric Bollman, a
traveler through Dunkard&rsquo;s Bottom, to his
brother Lewis Bollman, father of H. L.
Bollman of Pittsburg:</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Cumberland we have journeyed
over the Alleghany Mountains in company
with General Irwin, of Baltimore, who
owns some 50,000 acres in this vicinity.
The mountains are not so high and not so
unproductive as I had imagined them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
be. Several points are rocky and barren,
such as the Laurel Ridge, but even this
with proper attention and ... European
cultivation could be made productive. There
are proportionately few such ranges as this,
and for the greater part, the mountains are
covered with fine timber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We spent the first night at West Port.
Up to this point, at the proper seasons, the
Potomac is navigable and could be made so
quite a distance further. But even in the
present state the land journey to the
Monongahela, which is navigable and flows
into the Ohio, is but a distance of 60
miles....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The road is not in a bad condition and
could be made most excellent. This will,
without doubt, be accomplished just as
soon as the country is sufficiently inhabited,
since there is no nearer way to reach the
Western waters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next day we dined with Mr. M.
McCartin, still higher up in the mountains.
There are many settlements in this vicinity.
We were entertained in a beautiful, cool,
roomy house, surrounded by oat fields and
rich meadows, where the sound of the bells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
told that cattle were pasturing near by.
We dined from delicate china, had good
knives, good forks, spoons, and other
utensils. Our hostess, a bright, handsome,
healthy woman, waited upon us. After
dinner, a charming feminine guest arrived
on horseback; a young girl from the neighboring
farm, of perhaps 15 years of age,
with such bashful eyes and such rosy
cheeks, so lovely and attractive in manner
that even Coopley, our good mathematician,
could not restrain his admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the &lsquo;backwoods&rsquo; of America,
which the Philadelphian is pleased to
describe as a rough wilderness&mdash;while in
many parts of Europe, in Westphalia, in
the whole of Hungary and Poland, nowhere,
is there a cottage to be found,
which, taking all things together in consideration
of the inhabitant, can be compared
with the one of which I have just
written.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four miles from this we reached the
Glades, one of the most remarkable features
of these mountains and this land. These
are broad stretches of land of many thousand
acres, covered with dense forests;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
beyond this there is not a tree to be found,
but the ground is covered knee-deep with
grass and herbs, where both the botanist
and the cattle find delicious food. Many
hundred head of cattle are driven yearly,
from the South Branch and other surrounding
places, and entrusted to the care of the
people who live here. What can be the
cause of this strange phenomenon! One
can only suppose that at one time these
glades were covered with timber, which,
overthrown by a mighty hurricane, gradually
dried and fell into decay. But it would
take too long to give the many reasons and
arguments both for and against this supposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only lately have the Indians ceased
roving in this vicinity; which has done
much to delay its cultivation, but now it is
being cleared quite rapidly, and in a short
time will, without doubt, become a fine
place for pasturage. We spent the second
night with one named Boyle, an old Hollander.
Early the next morning we could
hear the howling of a wolf in the forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We breakfasted with Tim Friend, a
hunter, who lived six miles further on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
If ever Adam existed he must have looked
as this Tim Friend. I never saw such an
illustration of perfect manhood. Large,
strong and brawny; every limb in magnificent
proportion, energy in every movement
and strength in every muscle, his appearance
was the expression of manly independence,
contentment and intelligence. His
conversation satisfied the expectations
which it awakened. With gray head, 60
years old, 40 of which he had lived in the
mountains, and of an observing mind, he
could not find it difficult to agreeably entertain
people who wished for information.
He is a hunter by profession. We had
choice venison for breakfast, and there
were around the house and near by a great
number of deers, bears, panthers, etc. I
cannot abstain from believing that the
manly effort which must be put forth in
the hunt, the boldness which it requires,
the keen observation which it encourages,
the dexterity and activity which are necessary
to its success, act together more forcibly
for the development of the physical
and mental strength than any other occupation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Agriculture and cattle-raising, in their
beginning produce careless customs and
indolence; the mental faculties remain
weak, the ideas limited, and the imagination,
without counterpoise, extravagant.
Therefore we admire the wisdom and penetration
of the North American Indian, his
sublime eloquence and heroic spirit in contrast
to the Asiatic shepherd, from whom
we receive only simple Arabic fables. The
man, of whatever color he may be, is
always that which the irresistible influence
of his surroundings has formed him. We
left our noble hunter and his large, attractive
family unwillingly and followed a
roadway to Duncard&rsquo;s Bottom, on Cheat
river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had ridden along uneventfully for
about two hours. I was in advance, when
Joseph, who rode behind me, cried: &lsquo;Take
care, sir. Take care. There is a rattlesnake.&rsquo;
It lay upon the road and my horse
had almost stepped upon it, which would
have proved a disastrous thing. Joseph, a
good active fellow, sprang instantly from
his horse in order to kill it. The snake
disappeared in the bushes and rattled. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
sounded so exactly like the noise of a
grasshopper that I did not think it could be
anything else. Joseph armed himself with
a stout stick and heavy stone, followed the
snake, found it, and killed it, but then
jumped quickly back, for he saw close by
another rattlesnake, which had coiled itself
and was ready to spring at him. He hurried
back again and killed the second.
They were 3&frac12; feet long and nine inches in
circumference, in the thickest part of the
body; one had nine rattles and the other
five. We examined the poisonous fangs,
took the rattles with us and hung the
bodies on a tree. I had thought until now
that the principle of life was as stubborn in
a snake as in an eel, but found to my
astonishment that a slight blow was sufficient
to destroy it in this dangerous specimen.
Other observations touching upon
natural history I must keep for future discussion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We dined at Duncard&rsquo;s Bottom, crossed
the Cheat river in the afternoon, reached
the Monongahela Valley, spent the night
in a very comfortable blockhouse with Mr.
Zinn, and arrived the next day at Morgan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>town,
on the Monongahela. We spent a
day and a half here and were pleasantly
entertained by Mr. Reeder and William M.
Clary, and received much information,
especially concerning sugar, maple trees
and sugar making. From Morgantown we
went to the mouth of George creek,
Fayette county, Pennsylvania. As it was
afternoon when we reached here we were
overtaken by night and compelled to spend
the night in a small blockhouse with Mr.
McFarlain. We found Mr. McFarlain a
respectable, intelligent farmer, surrounded
as usual, by a large and happy family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Directly after our arrival the table was
set, around which the entire family assembled.
This appears to be the usual custom
in the United States with all people who
are in some measure in good circumstances.
One of the women, usually the prettiest,
has the honor of presiding at table. There
were good table appointments, fine china,
and the simple feast was served with the
same ceremony as in the most fashionable
society of Philadelphia. Never, I believe,
was there in any place more equality than
in this. Strangers who come at this time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of day at once enter the family circle.
This was the case with us. Mr. McFarlain
told us much about his farm and the misfortunes
with which he struggled when he
first cultivated the place upon which he
now lives. He has lived here 30 years, a
circumstance which is here very unusual,
because the adventure loving nature, together
with the wish to better their condition
and the opportunity, has led many
people to wander from place to place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Mr. McFarlain, when we
made this observation, &lsquo;I have always
believed there was truth in the saying,
&ldquo;A rolling stone gathers no moss.&rdquo; With
labor and industry I have at last succeeded,
and can still work as well as my sons.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said his wife, a jolly woman,
&lsquo;he does not do much. The most he does
is to go around and look at the work.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let him, let him,&rsquo; interrupted the
daughter, an energetic, pretty girl of perhaps
17 years, who was serving the coffee.
&lsquo;He worked hard when he was young.&rsquo;
And no girl of finer education could have
said it with more charming naivete or with
the appearance of more unaffected love.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;After the evening meal the eldest son
showed us to our bed-room. &lsquo;Shall I close
the window?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I usually sleep
here and always leave it open; it does not
harm me, and Dr. Franklin advises it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning when we came down
we found the old farmer sitting on the
porch reading a paper. Upon the table
lay &lsquo;Morse&rsquo;s Geography,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Beauty of
the Stars,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Vicar of Wakefield,&rsquo; and
other good books. I have entered into
particulars in my description of this family,
because we were then only five miles from
the home of Gallatin, where the people are
too often represented as rough, uncultured,
good-for-nothings. It is not necessary to
mention that all families here are not as
this, yet it is something to find a family
such as this, living on this side of the
mountains, 300 miles from the sea coast.
We called upon Mr. Gallatin, but did not
find him at home. Geneva is a little
place, but lately settled, at the junction of
George creek and the Monongahela.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From here we went to Uniontown,
the capital of Fayette county, where we
saw excellent land and Redstone creek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
We dined the following day in Redstone or
Brownsville; journeyed to Washington,
the capital of the county of the same name,
and arrived the following day in Pittsburg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of this city and its magnificent situation
between two mighty rivers, the Monongahela
and the Allegheny, I shall write
you another time. From the window
where I now sit, I have a view of the first
named river, a half mile long. It is as
broad as the Thames in London. The
bank on this side is high, but horizontal
and level, covered with short grass, such
as the sheep love, which reminds me of the
rock at Brighthelmstein. It is bordered
with a row of locust trees. The bank on
the other side is a chain of hills, thickly
shaded with oak and walnut trees. The
river flows quietly and evenly. Boats are
going back and forth; even now one is
coming, laden with hides from Illinois.
The people on board are wearing clothes
made of woolen bed blankets. They are
laughing and singing after the manner of
the French, yet as red as Indians, and
almost the antipodes of their fatherland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From here to the mouth of the Ohio it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
is 1,200 miles and 3,000 to the mouth of the
Mississippi. How enormous! How beautiful
it is to see the dominion of freedom
and common sense established. To see
in these grand surroundings the development
of good principle and the struggle
toward a more perfect life; to admire the
spirit of enterprise as it works toward a
great plan, which seems to be in relation
to the great plan which nature itself has
followed, and at last to anticipate by a
secret feeling, the future greatness and
prosperity which lies before this growing
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two years later Felix Renick passed this
way and includes in his account a vivid
picture of the earliest sort of taverns in the
West:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of our neighbors who had served
in Dunmore&rsquo;s campaign in 1774, gave accounts
of the great beauty and fertility of
the western country, and particularly the
Scioto valley, which inspired me with a
desire to explore it as early as I could
make it convenient. I accordingly set out
from the south branch of Potomac for that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
purpose, I think about the first of October,
1798, in company with two friends, Joseph
Harness and Leonard Stump, both of whom
have long since gone hence. We took
with us what provisions we could conveniently
carry, and a good rifle to procure
more when necessary, and further prepared
ourselves to camp wherever night overtook
us. Having a long journey before
us, we traveled slow, and reached Clarksburgh
the third night, which was then
near the verge of the western settlements
in Virginia, except along the Ohio river.
Among our first inquiries of our apparently
good, honest, illiterate landlord, was
whether he could tell us how far it was to
Marietta [Ohio], and what kind of trace
we should have? His reply was, &lsquo;O yes, I
can do that very thing exactly, as I have
been recently appointed one of the viewers
to lay out and mark a road from here to
Marietta, and have just returned from the
performance of that duty. The distance
on a <i>straight line</i> which we first run was
seventy-five miles, but on our return we
found and marked another line that was
much <i>nearer</i>.&rsquo; This theory to Mr. Harness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and myself, each of us having spent several
years in the study and practice of surveying,
was entirely new: we however let it
pass without comment, and our old host,
to his great delight, entertained us till late
in the evening, with a detailed account of
the fine sport he and his associates had in
their bear chases, deer chases, &amp;c., while
locating the road. We pursued our journey
next morning, taking what our host called
the nearest, and which he also said was
much the best route. The marks on both
routes being fresh and plain, the crooked
and nearest route, as our host called it,
frequently crossing the other, we took
particular notice of the ground the straight
line had to pass over, and after getting
through we were disposed to believe that
our worthy host was not so far wrong as
might be supposed. The straight line
crossing such high peaks of mountains,
some of which were so much in the sugar-loaf
form, that it would be quite as near to
go round as over them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first night after leaving the settlement
at Clarksburgh, we camped in the
woods; the next morning while our horses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
were grazing, we drew on our wallets and
saddlebags for a snack, that we intended
should pass for our breakfast, and set out.
We had not traveled far before we unexpectedly
came to a new improvement. A
man had gone there in the spring, cleared
a small field and raised a patch of corn,
&amp;c., staying in a camp through the summer
to watch it to prevent its being destroyed
by the wild animals. He had, a few days
before we came along, called on some of
his near neighbors on the Ohio, not much
more perhaps than thirty miles off, who
had kindly came forth and assisted him in
putting up a cabin of pretty ample size,
into which he had moved bag and baggage.
He had also fixed up a rock and trough,
and exposed a clapboard to view, with
some black marks on it made with a coal,
indicating that he was ready and willing to
accommodate those who pleased to favor
him with a call. Seeing these things, and
although we did not in reality need any
thing in his way, Mr. Harness insisted on
our giving him a call, observing that any
man that would settle down in such a wilderness
to accommodate travelers ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
be encouraged. We accordingly rode up
and called for breakfast, horse feed, &amp;c.
Then let me say that as our host had just
&lsquo;put the ball in motion,&rsquo; was destitute of
any helpmate whatever, (except a dog or
two,) he had of course to officiate in all the
various departments appertaining to a
hotel, from the landlord down to the shoe-black
on the one side, and from the landlady
down to the dishwash on the other.
The first department in which he had to
officiate was that of the hostler, next that
of the bar keeper, as it was then customary,
whether called for or not, to set out a half
pint of something to drink. The next,
which he fell at with much alacrity, was
that of the cook, by commencing with
rolled up sleeves and unwashed hands and
arms, that looked about as black and dirty
as the bears&rsquo; paws which lay at the cabin
door, part of whose flesh was the most considerable
item in our breakfast fare. The
first operation was the mixing up some
pounded corn meal dough in a little black
dirty trough, to which the cleaner, and perhaps
as he appeared to think him, the better
half of himself, his dog, had free access<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
before he was fairly done with it, and that
I presume was the only kind of cleaning it
ever got. While the dodgers were baking,
the bear meat was frying, and what he
called coffee was also making, which was
composed of an article that grew some hundred
or one thousand miles north of where
the coffee tree ever did grow. You now
have the bill of fare that we sat down to,
and the manner in which it was prepared;
but you must guess how much of it we ate,
and how long we were at it. As soon as
we were done we called for our bill, and
here follows the items: breakfast fifty
cents each, horses twenty-five each, half
pint of whisky fifty cents. Mr. Harness,
who had prevailed on us to stop, often
heard of the wilderness hotel, and whenever
mentioned, he always had some term
of reproach ready to apply to the host and
the dirty breakfast, though we often afterwards
met with fare somewhat similar in
all respects.</p>

<h3>THE GENESEE ROAD</h3>


<p>The military importance of the Mohawk
Valley and strategic portage
at Rome, New York, was emphasized
in our study of Portage Paths.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Throughout the French and Indian War
and the Revolutionary struggle the water
route to the Hudson from Lake Ontario,
by way of the Onondaga, Lake Oneida,
Wood Creek, and the Mohawk, was of great
moment. But only because it was a
route&mdash;a thoroughfare; not because the
territory through which it coursed was
largely occupied or of tremendous value.
The French held the lakes and the English
were constantly striving for foothold there.
When Fort Oswego was built on the
present site of Oswego, the first step by
the English was taken; the route had been
the river route with a portage at Fort Wil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>liams
(Rome). When Fort Niagara was
captured in 1759 by Sir William Johnson,
the French were driven from the Lakes;
Johnson&rsquo;s route to Niagara was by Lake
Ontario from Oswego. It has been suggested
that a volume of this series of
monographs should be given to the
campaigns of the English against Fort
Niagara. These campaigns were made
largely on waterways; they left no roads
which became of any real importance in
our national development. Certain campaigns
of the Old French War left highways
which have become of utmost significance;
only of these routes and their
story should this series be expected to
treat. Despite the two wars which had
created busy scenes in the Mohawk Valley,
no landward route connected it with
Niagara River and Lake Erie except the
Iroquois Trail.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> No military road was
built through the &ldquo;Long House of the
Iroquois.&rdquo; To gain the key of the western
situation&mdash;Niagara&mdash;the common route
was to Oswego. There were local roads
along the lake shore, and these were used
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
more or less by the troops. In the Revolution
no American general could get beyond
Fort Stanwix by land. Leger himself came
up the Oswego River to join Burgoyne.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the interior of New
York was an almost unexplored wilderness
at the end of the Revolution in 1783.
With the opening of the Genesee country
by the various companies which operated
there, a tide of immigration began to surge
westward from the upper Mohawk along the
general alignment of the old-time Iroquois
Trail. Utica sprang up on the site of old
Fort Schuyler, and marked the point of
divergence of the new land route of civilization
from the water route.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> This was
about 1786. In 1789 Asa Danworth erected
his salt works at Bogardus Corners, now
the city of Syracuse. Geneva, Batavia,
and Buffalo mark the general line of the
great overland route from Utica and Syracuse
across New York. It followed very
closely the forty-third meridian, dropping
somewhat to reach Buffalo.</p>

<p>The Great Genesee Road, as it was early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
known, began at old Fort Schuyler, as a
western extremity of the Mohawk Valley
road and later turnpike, and was built to
the Genesee River by a law passed March
22, 1794. In 1798 a law was passed extending
it to the western boundary of the
state. It was legally known as the Great
Genesee Road and the Main Genesee Road
until 1800. In that year the road passed
into the hands of a turnpike company the
legal name of which was &ldquo;The President
and Directors of the Seneca Road Company.&rdquo;
The old name clung to the road
however, and on the map here reproduced
we find it called the &ldquo;Ontario and Genesee
Turnpike Road.&rdquo; It forms the main street
of both the large cities through which it
passes, Syracuse and Utica, and in both it
is called &ldquo;Genesee Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first act of legislation which created
a Genesee Road from an Indian trail read
as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Be it enacted by the People of the State of
New York, represented in Senate and Assembly</i>
That Israel Chapin, Michael Myer, and
Othniel Taylor shall be and hereby are
appointed commissioners for the purpose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of laying out and improving a public road
or highway to begin at Old Fort Schuyler
on the Mohawk river and to run from
thence in a line as nearly straight as the
situation of the country will admit to the
Cayuga Ferry in the county of Onondaga
or to the outlet of the Cayuga lake at the
discretion of the said commissioners and
from the said outlet of the Cayuga lake or
from the said Cayuga Ferry as the same
may be determined on by the said commissioners
in a line as nearly straight as
the situation of the country will admit to
the town of Canadaquai and from thence
in a line as nearly straight as possible to
the settlement of Canawagas on the Genesee
river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And be it further enacted</i> That the said
road shall be laid out six rods wide, but it
shall not be necessary for the said commissioners
to open and improve the same
above four rods wide in any place thereof.
And the whole of the said road when laid
out, shall be considered as a public highway
and shall not be altered by the commissioners
of any town or country [county?]
through which the same shall run.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And be it further enacted</i> That the treasurer
of this State shall pay to the said commissioners
or any two of them a sum or
sums of money not exceeding in the whole
the sum of six hundred pounds out of the
monies in the treasury which have arisen
or may arise from the sale of military lotts
to be laid out and expended towards the
opening and improving that part of the said
road passing through the military lands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And be it further enacted</i> That for the
purpose of laying out opening and improving
the remainder of the said road, the
said treasurer shall pay unto the said commissioners
or any two of them out of any
monies in the treasury not otherwise appropriated
at the end of the present session
of the legislature a sum not exceeding
fifteen hundred pounds which said sum
shall be by them laid out and expended
in making or improving the remainder of
the said road as aforesaid. <i>Provided</i> that
no larger proportion of the said sum of
fifteen hundred pounds shall be appropriated
towards the opening and improving
of the said road in the county of Ontario
then in the county of Herkemer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And be it further enacted</i> That it shall
and may be lawful to and for the said commissioners
or any two of them to improve
the said road by contract or otherwise as to
them may appear the most proper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And be it further enacted</i> That where
any part of the said road shall be laid out
through any inclosed or improved lands
the owner or owners thereof shall be paid
the value of the said lands so laid out into
an highway with such damages as he, she
or they may sustain by reason thereof
which value and damages shall be settled
and agreed upon by the said commissioners
or any two of them and the parties interested
therein, and if they cannot agree,
then the value of the lands and damages
shall be appraised by two justices of the
peace, on the oaths of twelve freeholders
not interested in paying or receiving any
part of such appraisement, otherwise than
in paying their proportion of the taxes for
the contingent charges of the county which
freeholders shall be summoned by any
constable not otherwise interested than as
aforesaid, by virtue of a warrant to be issued
by the said two justices of the peace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
for that purpose, and the whole value of
the said lands so laid out into an highway,
and damages together with the costs of
ascertaining the value of the said damages
of the county in which the said lands shall
be situated are levied collected and paid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And be it further enacted</i> That each of
the said commissioners shall be entitled to
receive for their services the sum of sixteen
shillings for every day they shall be respectively
employed in the said business
to be paid by the respective counties in
which they shall so be employed which
sums shall be raised levied and paid
together with and in the same manner as
the necessary and contingent charges of
such county are raised levied and paid and
that the said commissioners shall account
with the auditor of this State for the
monies they shall respectively receive from
the treasurer of this State by virtue of this
act on or before the first day of January
one thousand seven hundred and ninety
six.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>A law entitled &ldquo;An act appropriating
monies for roads in the county of Onondaga<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and for other purposes therein mentioned,&rdquo;
passed April 11, 1796, contained the following
concerning the Genesee Road:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And be it further enacted</i> That the said
commissioners shall and they are hereby
strictly enjoined to expend two thousand
dollars of the said monies in repairing the
highway and bridges thereon heretofore
directed to be laid out by law and now
commonly called the Great Genesee road
from the eastern to the western bounds of
the said county of Onondaga and the residue
of the money aforesaid to expend in the
repair of such highways and the bridges
thereon in the said county as will tend
most extensively to benefit and accommodate
the inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And be it further enacted</i> That it shall be
the duty of the said commissioners and
they are hereby strictly enjoined to cause
all and every bridge which shall be constructed
under their direction over any
stream to be raised at least three feet
above the water at its usual greatest height
in the wettest season of the year and to
construct every such bridge of the most
durable and largest timber which can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
obtained in its vicinity, and that wherever
it can conveniently be done the road shall
be raised in the middle so as to enable the
water falling thereon freely to discharge
therefrom and shall pursue every other
measure which in their opinion will best
benefit the public in the expenditure of
the money committed to them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>In an act, passed April 1, 1796, supplementary
to an &ldquo;Act for the better support
of Oneida, Onondaga and Cuyuga Indians ...&rdquo;, it was ordered that from
the proceeds of all sales of lands bought of
the Indians the surveyor-general should
pay &pound;500 to the treasurer of Herkimer
County and a like amount to the treasurer
of Onondaga County; this money was
ordered to be applied to &ldquo;mending the
highway commonly called the Great Genesee
Road and the bridges thereon.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>A law of the year following, 1797,
affords one of the interesting uses of the
lottery in the development of American
highways. It reads:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereas it is highly necessary, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
direct communications be opened and improved
between the western, northern and
southern parts of this State. Therefore</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Be it enacted by the People of the State of
New York, represented in Senate and Assembly</i>,
That for the purpose of opening and improving
the said communications, the
managers herein after named shall cause
to be raised by three successive lotteries of
equal value, the sum of forty-five thousand
dollars. That out of the neat [net?] proceeds
of the first lottery the sum of eleven
thousand seven hundred dollars, and out of
the neat proceeds of the third lottery, the
further sum of two thousand two hundred
dollars shall be and hereby is appropriated
for opening and improving the road commonly
called the Great Genesee road, in
all its extent from Old Fort Schuyler in
the county of Herkimer to Geneva in the
county of Ontario....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The western movement to Lake Erie
became pronounced at this time; the
founders of Connecticut&rsquo;s Western Reserve
under General Moses Cleaveland emigrated
in 1796. The promoters of the Genesee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
country were advertising their holdings
widely. The general feeling that there
was a further West which was fertile, if
not better than even the Mohawk and Hudson
Valleys, is suggested in a law passed
March 2, 1798, which contained a clause
concerning the extension of the Genesee
Road:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And be it further enacted</i> That the commissioner
appointed in pursuance of the
act aforesaid, to open and improve the
main Genessee road, shall and he is hereby
authorized and empowered to lay out and
continue the main Genessee road, from the
Genessee river westward to the extremity
of the State. <i>Provided nevertheless</i>, that
none of the monies appropriated by the
said act shall be laid out on the part of the
road so to be continued; <i>and provided also</i>
that the said road shall be made at the
expense of those who may make donations
therefor.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The mania which swept over the United
States between 1790 and 1840 of investing
money in turnpike and canal companies was
felt early in New York. The success of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Lancaster Turnpike in Pennsylvania was
the means of foisting hundreds of turnpike-road
companies on public attention and
private pocket-books. By 1811, New York
State had at least one hundred and thirty-seven
chartered roads, with a total mileage
of four thousand five hundred miles, and
capitalized at seven and a half millions.</p>

<p>It is nothing less than remarkable that
this thoroughfare from the Mohawk to
Lake Erie should have been incorporated
as a turnpike earlier in point of time than
any of the routes leading to it (by way
either of the Mohawk Valley or Cherry
Valley) from Albany and the East. The
Seneca Road Company was incorporated
April 1, 1800. The Mohawk Turnpike and
Bridge Company was incorporated three
days later. The Cherry Valley routes came
in much later.</p>

<p>The Genesee Road was incorporated by
the following act, April 1, 1800:</p>

<p>&ldquo;An act to establish a turnpike road
company for improving the State road from
the house of John House in the village of
Utica, in the county of Oneida, to the
village of Cayuga in the county of Cayuga,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and from thence to Canadarque in the
county of Ontario.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Be it enacted by the People of the State of
New York represented in Senate and Assembly</i>
That Benjamin Walker, Charles Williamson,
Jedediah Sanger and Israel Chapin and
all such persons as shall associate for the
purpose of making a good and sufficient
road in the form and manner herein after
described from the house of John
House ... observing as nearly the
line of the present State [Genesee] road as
the nature of the ground will allow, shall
be and are hereby made a corporation and
body politic in fact and in name, by the
name of &lsquo;The President and Directors of
the Seneca Road Company&rsquo;....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The road was to be under the management
of nine directors and the capital stock
was to be two thousand two hundred shares
worth fifty dollars each. The directors
were empowered to enter upon any lands
necessary in building the road, specifications
being made for appraisal of damages.
The road was to &ldquo;be six rods in
width ... cleared of all timber except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>ing
trees of ornament, and to be improved
in the manner following, to wit, in the
middle of the said road there shall be
formed a space not less than twenty four
feet in breadth, the center of which shall
be raised fifteen inches above the sides,
rising towards the middle by gradual arch,
twenty feet of which shall be covered with
gravel or broken stone fifteen inches deep
in the center and nine inches deep on the
sides so as to form a firm and even surface.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tollgates were to be established when
the road was in proper condition every ten
miles; the rates of toll designated in this
law will be of interest for comparative
purposes:</p>

<p>The old Genesee Road passed through as
romantic and beautiful a land as heart
could wish to see or know; but the road
itself was a creation of comparatively
modern days, in which Seneca and Mohawk
were eliminated factors in the problem.
Here, near this road, a great experiment
was made a few years after its building,
when a canal was proposed and dug, amid
fears and doubts on the part of many, from
Albany to Buffalo. One of the first persons
to advocate a water highway which would
eclipse the land route, sent a number of
articles on the subject to a local paper,
whose editor was compelled to refuse to
print more of them, because of the ridicule
to which they exposed the paper! Poor as
the old road was in bad weather, people
could not conceive of any better substitute.</p>

<p>When the Erie Canal was being built, so
poor were the roads leading into the region
traversed by the canal, that contractors
were compelled to do most of their hauling
in winter, when the ground was frozen and
sleds could be used on the snow. Among
the reasons given&mdash;as we shall see in a
later monograph of this series&mdash;for delays
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
in completing portions of the canal, was
that of bad roads and the impossibility of
sending heavy freight into the interior
except in winter; and a lack of snow, during
at least one winter, seriously handicapped
the contractors. But when the Erie
Canal was built, the prophecies of its advocates
were fulfilled, as the rate per hundred-weight
by canal was only one-tenth the
rate charged by teamsters on the Genesee
Road. The old &ldquo;waggoners&rdquo; who, for a
generation, had successfully competed with
the Inland Lock Navigation Company,
could not compete with the Erie Canal, and
it was indeed very significant that, when
Governor Clinton and party made that first
triumphal journey by canal-boat from Buffalo
to Albany and New York&mdash;carrying
a keg of Lake Erie water to be emptied
into the Atlantic Ocean&mdash;they were not
joyously received at certain points, such as
Schenectady, where the old methods of
transportation were the principal means
of livelihood for a large body of citizens.
How delighted were the old tavern-keepers
in central New York with the opening of
the Erie Canal, on whose boats immigrants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
ate and slept? About as happy, we may
say, as were the canal operators when a
railway was built, hurrying travelers on at
such a rapid pace that their destinations
could be reached, in many cases, between
meals!</p>

<p>Yet until the railway came, the fast mail-stages
rolled along over the Genesee Road,
keeping alive the old traditions and the old
breed of horses. Local business was vastly
increased by the dawning of the new era;
society adapted itself to new and altered
conditions, and the old days when the
Genesee Road was a highway of national
import became the heritage of those who
could look backward and take hope for the
future, because they recognized better the
advances that each new year had made.</p>

<h3>A TRAVELER ON THE GENESEE ROAD</h3>


<p>Among the many records of travelers
on the famous Genesee Road, that of
Timothy Bigelow, as given in his
<i>Journal of a Tour to Niagara Falls in the
Year 1805</i>,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> approaches perhaps most nearly
to the character of a description of the old
highway which should be presented here:</p>

<p>&ldquo;July 14th. We proceeded [from Albany]
to Schenectady to breakfast, fifteen
miles, Beale&rsquo;s tavern; a good house. A
new turnpike is making from Albany to
this place; it is constructed in a very durable
manner, with a pavement covered with
hard gravel. That part which is completed
is now an excellent road; the remainder
will soon be equally good. It was not
disagreeable to us to be informed that this
road, and indeed all the other turnpikes,
and most other recent works which we met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
with, which required uncommon ingenuity
or labor, were constructed by Yankees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Schenectady seems not to be a word
fitted to common organs of speech. We
heard it pronounced Snacketady, Snackedy,
Ksnackidy, Ksnactady, Snackendy, and
Snackady, which last is much the most
common. To Ballston, Bromeling&rsquo;s, sixteen
miles; a most excellent house. We
found here about forty guests, but understood
there were upwards of two hundred
at Aldrich&rsquo;s, McMasters&rsquo;s, and the other
boarding-houses near. Bromeling himself
has accommodations in the first style for
one hundred and thirty persons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We met with but few people here from
Massachusetts. Mr. Henry Higginson and
his wife, Mr. Bingham, the bookseller, and
his family, were all we knew. The mineral
water was not agreeable to us all upon
the first experiment; but with others, and
myself in particular, it was otherwise. It
is remarkably clear and transparent; the
fixed air, which is continually escaping
from it, gives it a sparkling appearance,
and a lively and full taste, not unlike to
that of brisk porter or champagne wine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
while one is actually drinking....
We slept at Beals&rsquo;s. July 17th, we took
the western stage in company with a Mr.
Row, a gentleman from Virginia, who was
about to engage in trade at Geneva, on the
Seneca Lake. We crossed over to the
north side of the Mohawk soon after
setting out, to Schwartz&rsquo;s (still in Schenectady),
a poor house, seven miles; thence
to Pride&rsquo;s in Amsterdam, nine miles.
Pride&rsquo;s is a handsome limestone house,
built about fifty years since, as we were
informed, by Sir William Johnson, for his
son-in-law, Guy Johnson.... To
Abel&rsquo;s in Amsterdam, situated on Trapp&rsquo;s
Hill, opposite to the mouth of Schoharie
River and the old Fort Hunter, to dine.
The prospect to the south-west is extensive
and romantic, exhibits an agreeable mixture
of hills and plains, diversified with
extensive forests almost in a state of nature,
and cultivated fields scarce less extensive,
now covered with a rich harvest of
ripening wheat. The prospect was the
principal thing which we found in this
place to recommend it. The tavern is a
poor one, and our dinner of course was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
miserable. Four miles to Shepard&rsquo;s, in
Canajoharie, to sleep.... The Mohawk
in many places was shoal, and interrupted
with so many islands and sand-banks
that we were often at a loss to conceive
how loaded boats could pass, and yet
we saw several going up-stream with
heavy loads.... July 18th. To
Carr&rsquo;s at Little Falls, to breakfast, twenty
miles; a very good house. In this stage,
we passed the East Canada Creek. Observed
for the very first time the cypress-tree.
The gloomy, melancholy air of this
tree, and the deep shade which it casts,
resulting from the downward direction of
its branches, as well as the form and color
of its leaves, have very properly marked it
out as emblematical of mourning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On approaching the Little Falls, we
observed undoubted marks of the operation
of the water on rocks, now far out of their
reach, particularly the round holes worn
out [by] pebbles kept in a rotatory motion
by the current, so common at all falls. It
is certain that heretofore the falls must
have been some ways further down stream,
and have been much greater than they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
now are, and that the German flats, and
other low grounds near the river above,
must have been the bed of a lake. The
falls occupy about half a mile. In some
spots, the river is so crowded between
rocks, that one might almost pass across it;
in most places, however, it is broken into
a number of streams by irregular masses
of limestone rock. There is here a commodious
canal for the passage of boats cut
round these falls. The whole fall is fifty-four
feet; and there are five locks, in each
of which the fall is ten feet, besides the
guard-lock, where it is four. The locks
are constructed of hewn stone, and are of
excellent workmanship; they are almost
exactly upon the construction of those at
the head of Middlesex canal. Most of the
buildings in the neighborhood, as well as
two beautiful bridges over the canal here,
are also of limestone. Carr and his wife
are from Albany, and are agreeable and
genteel people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Trowbridge&rsquo;s Hotel, in Utica, to
dine. The house is of brick, large, commodious,
and well attended. We found
good fare here; in particular, excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
wine. From Little Falls to this is twenty-two
miles. In this stage, we passed the
German flats, an extensive and well-cultivated
tract of internal land on both sides
the Mohawk. The town of German Flats
is on the south of the town of Herkimer,
opposite thereto, on the north side of the
river. Notwithstanding the celebrity of
this spot for the excellence of its soil, we
thought it not equal to that on Connecticut
River. Having passed the West Canada
Creek, the hills on both sides the river
seem to subside, and open to the view an
extensive and almost unbounded tract of
level and fertile country, though of a much
newer aspect than any we had seen before.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">WESTERN NEW YORK in 1809</span>
</div>


<p>&ldquo;At Utica, we passed over to the southern
side of the Mohawk. The river here
is about the size of the Nashua, and from
this place bends off to the north-west.
We happened to pass the bridge as a batteau
was coming up to a store at the end of
it, to discharge its cargo. The water was
so shoal that the batteau grounded before
it could be brought to its proper place. A
pair of horses were attached to its bows,
and it was not without the assistance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
several men, added to the strength of the
horses, that it was got up to the landing-place
at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morality and religion do not seem to
have much hold of the minds of people in
this region. Instances of rudeness and
profanity are to be met with in almost
every place, but the people engaged in
unloading the batteau were much more
extravagantly and unnecessarily profane
than is common. Several persons also,
whom I saw at Little Falls this morning,
told me that they knew full well that
Adam could not have been the first man,
or that he must have lived much longer
ago than the Scriptures declare, because
they said it must be more than five thousand
years for the Mohawk to have broken
through the rocks, as it has done at those
falls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Utica was begun to be settled sixteen
years ago, and is now a little city, and contains
several elegant dwelling-houses, some
of which are of brick, and a few of stone,
together with a great number of stores and
manufactories of different kinds. The
Lombardy poplar-tree is cultivated here in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
great abundance. The facility of transportation
by means of the Mohawk and
Hudson Rivers on one side, and Wood
Creek, Oneida, and Ontario Lakes on the
other, together with the extraordinary
fertility of the adjacent country, must at no
great distance of time make Utica a place
of great business and resort, and of course
its population must rapidly increase.
Moses Johnson, a broken trader, late of
Keene, now of Manlius, a little above
this place, whom we saw at Trowbridge&rsquo;s,
spoke of this country as not favorable for
traders, and that a very few stores of goods
would overstock the market. It is natural,
however, for people in his situation to
ascribe their misfortunes to anything
rather than their own imprudence or misconduct,
which others would probably consider
as the true cause of them. Mr.
Charles Taylor and his father, whom we
had overtaken at Shepard&rsquo;s, we left at
Utica.</p>

<p>&ldquo;July 19th. To Laird&rsquo;s in Westmoreland,
to breakfast, eleven miles; a very
good house. Our breakfast here was
garnished with a dish of excellent honey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Every thing in and about the house was
neat, and we were particularly struck with
the genteel and comely appearance of two
young ladies, daughters of our landlord,
one of whom, we were told, had attended a
ball in the neighborhood, I think at Paris,
the evening before. This stage was over
a tract of very fertile country, nearly level,
but a little ascending; the growth was
mostly of rock-maple and lime-tree. We
passed a creek in New Hartford, called
Sawguet, or Sogwet, or Sacada [Sauquoit],
and another in a corner of Paris called
Kerry, or Riscana, say Oriskany. The
whole country from Utica to this place is
thickly settled. The houses are mostly
well built, and many of them handsome;
very few log houses to be seen. Young
orchards are numerous and thrifty, and
Lombardy poplars line the road a great
part of the way; and yet we saw not a
single field which had not the stumps of
the original forest trees yet remaining in
it. Honey is sent from hence to Lake Ontario,
in barrels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Shethar&rsquo;s in Sullivan, eighteen
miles, to dine; a good tavern. The face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of the country is not so level here as about
Utica, though it cannot be called hilly,
even here. In addition to the forest trees
which we had before seen, we here found
the shag-bark nut tree in abundance. In
this stage, we passed through the Oneida
Indian village.... In this stage,
we also passed the Skanandoa Creek, the
first water we met with which discharges
itself into the ocean by the St. Lawrence,
as the Oriskany was the last which pays
tribute to the Hudson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We next passed the Oneida Creek,
which unites with the Skanandoa. The
earth in some places here is of the same
color with that on Connecticut River,
where the red freestone is found. In the
Oneida village, the fields are free from
stumps, the first to be met that are so from
Utica to this place.... To Tyler&rsquo;s
in Onondaga Hollow, to sleep, twenty-one
miles. The last sixteen miles are over a
very hilly country; the Canaseraga Mountain,
in particular, is four or five miles
over, and very steep....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The country, as we approached Onondaga
Hollow, we found had been longer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
settled than nearer the Oneida village,
because the last cession of the Oneidas on
the west, and immediately contiguous to
their present reservation, was made but six
or eight years ago, whereas the country to
the westward of that had begun to be settled
some time before. The town of Manlius,
in particular, has the appearance of a flourishing
settlement. This town is the first
in the <i>Military Tract</i>, which is the lands
given by the State of New York as a gratuity
to the officers and soldiers of their
line in the Revolutionary Army. As we
were descending into the Onondaga Hollow,
we saw to the north-westward the
Salina or Onondaga Lake....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Onondaga Creek, which is of a
convenient size for a mill-stream, runs
along the Hollow from south to north, as
do all the other streams in this country.
This creek passes near the celebrated Onondaga
salt springs, which are situated about
five or six miles northward from
Tyler&rsquo;s.... July 20th. Rose at
half past two o&rsquo;clock, and proceeded to
Andrew&rsquo;s, at Skaneateles, to breakfast, sixteen
miles; a good tavern. The country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
is still hilly, but very fertile. The soil
is deep,&mdash;a mixture of loam and clay.
The roads here must be very bad in wet
weather. It rained last night for the first
time since we commenced our journey;
and the horses&rsquo; feet, in consequence
thereof, slipped as if they were travelling
on snow or ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rising out of Onondaga Hollow is a
long and very steep hill. The road is constructed
on the southern side of a precipice,
in such a manner that, as you approach
the top of the hill, you have a
tremendous gulf on your left hand, at the
bottom of which you hear the murmur of a
brook fretting among the rocks, as it is
passing on toward the Onondaga Creek,
which it joins in the Hollow. There
is a kind of railing or fence, composed
of logs secured with stakes or trees,
which is all that prevents the passenger,
and even the road itself, from falling to
the bottom of the gulf. On the hill we
found the embryo of a village. A court-house
is already built, and the frame of a
hotel is raised. The hotel, we were told,
is to be kept by one Brunson. It is an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
accommodation much needed by travellers
on this road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Harris&rsquo;s in Cayuga, fifteen miles,
to dine. We here had an excellent dinner
of beefsteaks. Mr. Harris told us that
they could keep beef fresh four or five
days, in hot weather, by hanging it upon
the trees&mdash;wrapping it in flannel&mdash;as
high as was convenient. Flannel is better
to wrap it in than linen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The village of Cayuga is small, but
pleasant and lively. It is in the township
of Marcellus, on the eastern bank of the
Cayuga Lake, within one or two miles of
its northern extremity. This lake is about
two miles wide in general, and almost forty
miles long. Nearly north and south from
the village, there are about fifteen miles of
the lake in sight. The shores are mostly of
hard land, except at the northern extremity,
where there is a great deal of marsh,
which is an unfavorable circumstance for
the village, as it is not only disagreeable to
the sight, but, I think, also to the smell.
There is a wooden bridge across the lake,
leading from Cayuga village towards
Geneva, one mile long, wanting three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
roods. It suffered so much by shocks of
the ice last winter, that in some places it
is hardly safe to pass it. This forenoon we
had passed the outlet of the Owasco Lake,
but did not see the lake itself, which we
were told was about a mile south of the
road. The country hitherto is somewhat
uneven, though by no means so much so
as near the Onondaga Hollow. The soil,
however, is excellent in many places, and
is of a reddish color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Powell&rsquo;s Hotel in Geneva, to sleep,
sixteen miles; excellent accommodations.
At Harris&rsquo;s we had met with a Mr. Rees,
a gentleman in trade at Geneva, who took
passage in the stage with us for that place.
From this gentleman, whom we found very
intelligent and communicative, we learned
many particulars concerning the salt
springs, discovered about five years since
upon the Cayuga outlet. These springs
are about twelve miles below the Cayuga
bridge, and are on both sides
the outlet: that on the western side is in
the township of Galen, and belongs to Mr.
Rees and his partner in trade. These
springs had long been known to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Indians, but they had always been reserved
in communicating their knowledge of the
state of the country to the white settlers.
It was not till most or all of those who
lived near this outlet had died or moved
away, except one, that he mentioned the
existence of these springs; and for a reward
he conducted some persons to the
place where they are situated. The persons
to whom he communicated this information
endeavored to purchase the favored
spot before the owner should be apprised
of its inestimable value; but he accidentally
obtained a knowledge of his good fortune,
and of course refused to sell....</p>

<p>The road from Cayuga to Geneva is for a
few miles along the southern or south-eastern
side, and the rest along the northern
or north-eastern side of the Seneca
outlet. The face of the country near the
road is more level; but the soil is more
sandy and uninviting than we had lately
seen, till we approached near to Geneva.
The land there is excellent, as we were
told it was, through all the tract which
extends between the Cayuga and Seneca
Lakes. This tract rises in a kind of regu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>lar
glacis from each lake, so that from the
middle of it one can see both. It wants
nothing but inhabitants and cultivation to
make it an elysium. The Seneca outlet
flows into the lower end of the Cayuga
Lake. Towards its mouth there is a considerable
fall, or rather rapid, which it is
contemplated to lock, whereby a water
communication will be opened between
the two lakes. The stream is about half
the size of the Winnipiseogee, and has a
bluish-white appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were within half a mile of Geneva
before we came in sight of the Seneca
Lake. This charming sheet of water extends
southerly from this place to Catharine
Town, forty miles, being from two to four
miles wide. There is not a foot of swamp
or marsh on its borders, from one extremity
to the other; but it is everywhere lined by
a clear, gravelly beach, and the land rises
from it with a very gentle and graceful
ascent in every direction....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not far from Geneva are some of the
Indian orchards, which were cut down by
General Sullivan in his famous expedition,
scarce less barbarous than those of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
savages themselves. The trees now growing
in these orchards sprouted from the
roots of those which were cut down, and
therefore grow in clusters, six or seven
rising from one root. We saw Indian
fields here free from stumps, the only ones
which are to the westward of Utica, except
those belonging to the Oneidas. We were
told that, at this season of the year, the
wind at Geneva blows constantly from the
south in the forenoon, and from the north
in the afternoon. We here quitted the
stage, which runs no further than Canandaigua,
and hired an open Dutch wagon
and driver, and a single horse, to carry us
to Niagara.... The turnpike road
ends at this place [Canandaigua]. The
whole length from Albany is two hundred
and six or seven miles: it may properly be
called two turnpikes, which join each other
at Utica. A project is on foot for still
extending the turnpike even to Niagara, a
direct course to which would not probably
exceed one hundred miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rees told us yesterday that he
was engaged to proceed to-morrow with
certain commissioners to mark out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
course of the road, and that the proprietors
will begin to work upon it next year.
The road may not be very good property
at first, but will probably soon become so,
judging from the astonishing rapidity with
which this country is settled. It is ascertained
that one thousand families migrated
hither during the last year, two thirds of
whom were from New England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Hall&rsquo;s in Bloomfield, to sleep,
twelve miles; very good house. We had
an excellent supper and clean beds. The
town of Bloomfield has been settled about
fifteen years, and is now in a flourishing
state. Here is a handsome new meeting-house
with a tasty steeple. The vane on
the steeple is rather whimsical. It is a
flying angel, blowing a trumpet against the
wind.... To Hosmer&rsquo;s in Hartford,
to breakfast, twelve and a half miles.
Between Bloomfield and this, we passed
through Charleston, which has but recently
been reclaimed from the wilderness. It is
perfectly flat, the soil is pretty good, though
better, and more settled at some distance
from the road than near it. The reason
of cutting the road where it goes was be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>cause
the country in that direction was
open, when it was first explored, between
this place and Lake Ontario, which is but
twenty-eight miles distant, or to Gerundegut
[now Toronto] Bay, but twenty-two
miles....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hitherto we have found better roads
since we left the turnpike than before, except
that the bridges and causeways are
mostly constructed with poles. Hosmer,
our landlord, is an intelligent man and
keeps a good tavern. We had for breakfast
good coffee, excellent tea, loaf sugar,
mutton chop, waffles, berry pie, preserved
berries, excellent bread, butter, and a salad
of young onions. I mention the particulars,
because some of the articles, or such
a collection, were hardly to be expected in
such a depth of wilderness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Gansen&rsquo;s in Southampton, twelve
and a half miles, to dine. Within about a
mile of Hosmer&rsquo;s, we passed the Genesee
River. The outlet of the Conesus Lake
joins this river about a mile above, or to
the south. Where we crossed, there is a
new bridge, apparently strong and well
built; and yet the water last spring under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>mined
one end of it, so that it has sunk
considerably....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gansen&rsquo;s is a miserable log house. We
made out to obtain an ordinary dinner.
Our landlord was drunk, the house was
crowded with a dozen workmen, reeking
with rain and sweat, and we were, withal,
constantly annoyed with the plaintive and
frightful cries and screams of a crazy
woman, in the next room. We hastened
our departure, therefore, even before the
rain had ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Russell&rsquo;s in Batavia, twelve miles,
to sleep. One mile from Gansen&rsquo;s, we
crossed Allen&rsquo;s Creek, at Buttermilk Falls,
where there are mills, and five miles
further the Chookawoonga Creek, near the
eastern transit line of the Holland purchase.
This line extends from the bounds
of Pennsylvania to Lake Ontario, a distance
of near ninety-four miles. So far, the road
was the worst of any we had seen; and
none can be much worse and be passable
for wheels. Within six miles of Batavia,
the road is much better, and the land of
a good quality, heavily timbered all the
way, but especially near the settlement. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
is but three years since this spot was first
cleared, and it is now a considerable village.
Here is a large building, nearly
finished, intended for a court-house, jail,
and hotel, under the same roof. The
street is perfectly level, and is already a
good and smooth road. Here is also an
excellent mill, on a large and commodious
scale, situated on the Tonawanda Creek,
which is the first water we saw which
passes over Niagara Falls. Russell&rsquo;s is a
poor tavern. We were told that our sheets
were clean, for they had been slept in but
a <i>few</i> times since they were washed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;July 23d. To Luke&rsquo;s in Batavia, to
breakfast, five miles. We intended to have
stopped at McCracken&rsquo;s, one mile short of
this, but we were told that we could not be
accommodated. The exterior appearance
of both houses was very much alike; they
are log huts, about twelve feet square.
Luke&rsquo;s consisted of a single room, with a
small lean-to behind, which served for a
kitchen. It contained scarce any furniture,
not even utensils enough to serve us comfortably
for breakfast....</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was but eighteen months since Luke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
began a settlement here, and he was the
first who made the attempt between Batavia
and Vandevener&rsquo;s, a distance of eighteen
miles, though in that distance now there
are several huts. Taverns like Luke&rsquo;s are
not uncommon in this vicinity; almost
every hut we saw had a sign hung out on
a pole or stump, announcing that it was an
inn. Perhaps such complete poverty did
not exist in them all as we found at Luke&rsquo;s,
yet, judging from external appearances, the
difference could not be great.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We passed the Tonawanda near Batavia
court-house, and then kept along its southern
bank to this place. The woods are full
of new settlers. Axes were resounding,
and the trees literally falling about us as we
passed. In one instance, we were obliged
to pass in a field through the smoke and
flame of the trees which had lately been
felled and were just fired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Vandevener&rsquo;s in Willink, thirteen
miles. We had intended only to dine
here; but by reason of a thunder shower,
and the temptation of comfortable accommodations,
we concluded not to proceed till
next day. Our last stage was through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Batavia woods, famed for their horrors,
which were not abated by our having been
informed at Russell&rsquo;s, that not far from here
a white man had lately been killed by the
Indians. We found the road much better
than we had anticipated; the last four
miles were the worst. A little labor would
make the road all very good, at least in dry
weather. There is another way to come
from Batavia here; but it is six miles
further, and probably little or no better
than this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was but three years since Vandevener
began here. He at first built a log house,
but he has now a two-story framed house,
adjoining that. His whole territory is five
hundred acres, one hundred of which he
has already got under improvement....</p>

<p>&ldquo;July 23d. To Ransom&rsquo;s in Erie, to
breakfast, fourteen miles. Ransom came
from Great Barrington in Massachusetts,
and settled here last September....
The last three miles from Ellicott&rsquo;s Creek
to Ransom&rsquo;s is a new road cut through a
thick wood, and is as bad as any part of
the road through the Batavia woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Crow&rsquo;s at Buffalo Creek, eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
miles. In this stage, we passed the Four
Mile Creek. Half the distance from Ransom&rsquo;s
was over open country, ... in
which many young chestnut-trees are just
sprouting from the ground. The rest of
our way was through a thick wood, where
the growth is the same kind as in the interior

<h3>THE CATSKILL TURNPIKE</h3>


<p>So few writers have paid any attention
to the influence of roads in the development
of our country that it is a great
pleasure to find in Francis Whiting Halsey&rsquo;s
<i>The Old New York Frontier</i>,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> a chapter on
the old Catskill Turnpike; through the
kindness of the author it is possible to
present here this story of that strategic
highway of old New York:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before the Revolutionary War something
of a road had been cut through the
woods from Otsego Lake southward along
the Susquehanna, and other primitive roads
led to and from the lake; but these highways
had almost disappeared during the
later years of the war, when Nature had
done her effective work of reclamation.
The one leading from the lake southward
was improved in 1786 as far as Hartwick,
and others were speedily taken in hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Further down the river efforts were made
to establish convenient communication
with the Hudson, and out of this grew a
road which eventually became the great
highway for a large territory. It was called
the Catskill Turnpike, and had its terminus
on the Susquehanna at Wattles&rsquo;s Ferry.<a name="FNanchor_411_42" id="FNanchor_411_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;This road, as a turnpike, properly
dates from 1802, but the road itself is much
older. Its eastern end had been opened
long before the Revolution with a terminus
in the Charlotte Valley. It seems then to
have been hardly more than a narrow
clearing through the forest, what farmers
call a &lsquo;wood road,&rsquo; or frontiersman a
&lsquo;tote road.&rsquo; It served as a convenient
route to the Susquehanna, because much
shorter than the older route by the Mohawk
Valley. Over this road on horseback in
1769, came Colonel Staats Long Morris and
his wife, the Duchess of Gordon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the war demands rose for a better
road, and one was soon undertaken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
with its terminus at Wattles&rsquo;s Ferry.
This terminus appears to have been chosen
because the river here was deep enough to
permit the use of &lsquo;battoes&rsquo; during the
low water that prevailed in summer. By
the summer of 1788 the road was in passable
condition. Alexander Harper and Edward
Paine in February, 1789, declared
that they had been to &lsquo;a very great expense
in opening the roads from Catskill
and the Hudson to the Susquehanna
River.&rsquo; In the same year a petition was
filed for a road &lsquo;from the Ouleout to
Kyuga Lake.&rsquo; The road to Cayuga Lake
(Ithaca) made slow progress, and in 1791
General Jacob Morris addressed to Governor
Clinton a letter which shows that it
was then still to be undertaken. Early in
1790 the State had taken the road to
Catskill in charge. In August, G. Gelston
made up from surveys a map from Catskill
&lsquo;running westerly to the junction of the
Ouleout Creek with the Susquehanna
River.&rsquo; The country had been previously
explored for the purpose by James Barker
and David Laurence.<a name="FNanchor_42_43" id="FNanchor_42_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1791 Sluman Wattles charged his
cousin, Nathaniel Wattles, &pound;4, 6<i>s.</i> for
&lsquo;carting three barrells from your house to
Catskill,&rsquo; &pound;1 for &lsquo;five days work on the
road,&rsquo; and 15 shillings for &lsquo;inspecting
road.&rsquo; Besides Nathaniel Wattles, Menad
Hunt was interested in the work, and in
1792 the two men appealed to the state to
be reimbursed for money paid out above
the contract price.<a name="FNanchor_43_44" id="FNanchor_43_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> During this year the
father of the late Dr. Samuel H. Case, of
Oneonta, emigrated to the upper Ouleout
from Colchester, Conn., with his seven
brothers. They drove cattle and sheep
ahead of them, and consumed eight days
in making the journey from the Hudson
River. Solomon Martin went over the road
in the same year, using Sluman Wattles&rsquo;s
oxen, for which he was charged &pound;1, 17<i>s.</i>
He went to Catskill, and was gone fifteen
days. This road was only twenty-five feet
wide. In 1792 a regular weekly mail-route
was established over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are among the many roads which
were opened in the neighborhood before
the century closed&mdash;before the Catskill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Turnpike, as a turnpike, came into existence.
Nearly every part of the town of
Unadilla, then embracing one-third of
Otsego County, had been made accessible
before the year 1800. The pioneers had
taken up lands all through the hill country.
But the needs of the settlers had not been
fully met. All over the State prevailed
similar conditions. The demands that
poured in upon State and town authorities
for road improvements became far in excess
of what could be satisfied. Everywhere
fertile lands had been cleared and sown to
grain, but the crops were so enormous that
they could neither be consumed at home
nor transported to market elsewhere.
Professor McMaster says that &lsquo;the heaviest
taxes that could have been laid would not
have sufficed to cut out half the roads or
build half the bridges that commerce
required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of this condition grew the policy
of granting charters to turnpike companies,
formed by well-to-do land-owners, who
undertook to build roads and maintain
them in proper condition for the privilege
of imposing tolls. Men owning land and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
possessed of ready money, were everywhere
eager to invest in these enterprises.
They not only saw the promise of dividends,
but ready sales for their lands. At
one time an amount of capital almost equal
to the domestic debt of the nation when
the Revolution closed was thus employed
throughout the country. By the year
1811, no fewer than 137 roads had been
chartered in New York State alone, with a
total length of 4,500 miles and a total capital
of $7,500,000. About one-third of this
mileage was eventually completed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight turnpikes went out from Albany,
and five others joined Catskill, Kingston,
and Newburg with the Susquehanna and
Delaware rivers. The earliest of these
five, and one of the earliest in the State,
was the Catskill and Susquehanna turnpike,
that supplanted the primitive State
road to Wattles&rsquo;s Ferry. The old course
was changed in several localities, the charter
permitting the stockholders to choose
their route. Among the names in the
charter were John Livingston, Caleb Benton
(a brother of Stephen Benton), John
Kortright, Sluman Wattles, and Solomon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Martin. The stock was limited to $12,000
in shares of $20 each.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The road ran through lands owned by
the stockholders. Little regard was had
for grades, as travellers well know. The
main purpose was to make the land accessible
and marketable. The road was completed
in 1802, and soon became a famous
highway to Central New York, and the
navigable Susquehanna, and so remained
for more than a quarter of a century. It
was in operation four years earlier than the
Great Western Turnpike, connecting Albany
with Buffalo and running through
Cherry Valley. Spafford in 1813 described
it as &lsquo;the Appian Way turnpike,&rsquo; in which
it seems the pride felt in it, likened as it
thus was to one of the best roads ever
built by man&mdash;that Roman highway which
still does service after the lapse of more
than 2,000 years. In one sense this turnpike
was like a Roman road: it followed
straight lines from point to point regardless
of hills, obstacles being squarely faced
and defied by these modern men as by the
old Romans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten toll-gates were set up along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
line, with the rates as follows: for twenty
sheep and hogs, eight cents; for twenty
horses and cattle, twenty cents; for a
horse and rider, five cents; for a horse
and chaise, twelve and one-half cents; for
a coach or chariot, twenty-five cents; for
a stage or wagon, twelve and one-half
cents. In 1804, Caleb Benton, who lived
in Catskill, was president of the corporation,
and in 1805 the stage business of the
road was granted as a monopoly to David
Bostwick, Stephen Benton, Lemuel Hotchkiss,
and Terence Donnelly. Two stages
were to be kept regularly on the road, the
fare to be five cents per mile. A stage that
left Catskill Wednesday morning reached
Unadilla Friday night, and one that left
Unadilla Sunday reached Catskill Tuesday.
The most prosperous period for the road
was the ten years from 1820 to 1830.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two years after the road was built, Dr.
Timothy Dwight, President of Yale College,
during one of his regular vacation
journeys, passed over it and stopped at
Unadilla. He has left a full record of the
journey. Dr. Dwight, accustomed long to
the comforts of life in New England, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
no sooner crossed the State line from
Massachusetts to New York than he observed
a change. The houses became
ordinary and ill repaired, and very many
of them were taverns of wretched appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For sixteen or eighteen miles, he saw
neither church nor school-house. Catskill
contained about 100 houses, and much of
the business was done by barter. The
turnpike to the Susquehanna he described
as a &lsquo;branch of the Greenwood turnpike
from Hartford to Albany, commencing
from Canaan in Connecticut and passing to
Wattles&rsquo;s Ferry on the Susquehanna.
Thence it is proposed to extend it to the
county of Trumbull on the southern shore
of Lake Erie.&rsquo; The road he thought &lsquo;well
made.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Connecticut families were found settled
along the line. Now he came upon &lsquo;a few
lonely plantations recently begun upon the
road,&rsquo; and then &lsquo;occasionally passed a cottage,
and heard the distant sound of an axe
and of a human voice. All else was
grandeur, gloom and solitude.&rsquo; At last
after many miles of riding he reached a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
settlement &lsquo;for some miles a thinly built
village, composed of neat, tidy houses,&rsquo; in
which everything &lsquo;indicated prosperity.&rsquo;
This was Franklin. Coming down the
Ouleout, the country, he said, &lsquo;wore a
forbidding aspect, the houses being thinly
scattered and many of them denoted great
poverty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Dr. Dwight reached Wattles&rsquo;s
Ferry, the more serious trials of his journey
began. All the privations of life in a new
country which he had met on the road
from Catskill at last had overtaxed his
patience, and he poured forth his perturbed
spirit upon this infant settlement.
When he made a second visit a few years
later he liked the place much better. His
first impressions are chronicled at some
length. He says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When we arrived at the Susquehanna
we found the only inn-keeper, at the eastern
side of the river, unable to furnish us
a dinner. To obtain this indispensable
article we were obliged therefore to cross
the river. The ferry-boat was gone. The
inhabitants had been some time employed
in building a bridge, but it was un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>finished
and impassable. There was nothing
left us, therefore, but to cross a deep
and rapid ford. Happily the bottom was
free from rocks and stones.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Dwight appears to have found no
satisfactory stopping-place in Unadilla, and
proceeds to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;About four miles from the ferry we
came to an inn kept by a Scotchman named
Hanna. Within this distance we called at
several others, none of which could furnish
us a dinner. I call them inns because this
name is given them by the laws of the
State, and because each of them hangs out
a sign challenging this title. But the law
has nicknamed them, and the signs are
liars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is said, and I suppose truly, that
in this State any man who will pay for an
inn-keeper&rsquo;s license obtains one of course.
In consequence of this practice the number
of houses which bear the appellation is
enormous. Too many of them are mere
dramshops of no other use than to deceive,
disappoint and vex travellers and to spread
little circles of drunkenness throughout
the State. A traveller after passing from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
inn to inn in a tedious succession finds that
he can get nothing for his horse and nothing
for himself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The remedy he prescribed for this was
to license &lsquo;only one inn where there are
five or six.&rsquo; The evil was general. In
1810 the people of Meredith made a formal
and vigorous protest against the growth of
intemperance and crime as caused by public
houses. There were ten hotels in that
town alone, besides a number of distilleries.
Many citizens banded themselves in behalf
of order and decency, and their protest
abounded in an energy of language that
would have delighted the soul of Dr.
Dwight. Of his further experience at Mr.
Hanna&rsquo;s hotel, he says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We at length procured a dinner and
finding no house at a proper distance
where we could be lodged concluded to
stay where we were. Our fare was indeed
bad enough, but we were sheltered from
the weather. Our inn-keeper besides
furnishing us with such other accommodations
as his home afforded, added to it the
pleasures of his company and plainly considered
himself as doing us no small favor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
In that peculiar situation in which the
tongue vibrates with its utmost ease and
celerity, he repeated to us a series of anecdotes
dull and vulgar in the extreme. Yet
they all contained a seasoning which was
exquisite, for himself was in every case
the hero of the tale. To add to our amusement,
he called for the poems of Allan
Ramsay and read several of them to us in
what he declared to be the true Scottish
pronunciation, laughing incessantly and
with great self-complacency as he proceeded.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Dwight remarks that &lsquo;a new turnpike
road is begun from the ferry and intended
to join the Great Western road
either at Cayuga bridge or Canandaigua.
This route will furnish a nearer journey
to Niagara than that which is used at
present.&rsquo; We see from this what were the
plans of that day, as to the future central
highway of New York State. Of Unadilla
Dr. Dwight says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That township in which we now were
is named Unadilla and lies in the county of
Otsego. It is composed of rough hills and
valleys with a handsome collection of inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>vales
along the Susquehanna. On a remarkably
ragged eminence immediately
north-west of the river, we saw the first
oaks and chestnuts after leaving the neighborhood
of Catskill. The intervening
forests were beach, maple, etc. The
houses in Unadilla were scattered along the
road which runs parallel with the river.
The settlement is new and appears like
most others of a similar date. Rafts containing
each from twenty to twenty-five
thousand feet of boards are from this township
floated down the Susquehanna to
Baltimore. Unadilla contained in 1800
eight hundred and twenty-three inhabitants.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;On September 27, 1804, Dr. Dwight
left Mr. Hanna&rsquo;s inn and rode through to
Oxford. The first two miles of the way
along the Susquehanna were &lsquo;tolerably
good and with a little labor capable of
being excellent.&rsquo; He continues:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We then crossed the Unadilla, a river
somewhat smaller but considerable longer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
(sic) than the Susquehanna proper, quite as
deep and as difficult to be forded. Our
course to the river was south-west. We
then turned directly north along the banks
of the Unadilla, and travelling over a
rugged hill, passed through a noble cluster
of white pines, some of which though not
more than three feet in diameter, were, as
I judged, not less than 200 feet in height.
No object in the vegetable world can be
compared with this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eleven years later, Dr. Dwight again
passed over the turnpike on his way to
Utica. &lsquo;The road from Catskill to Oxford,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;I find generally bad, as
having been long neglected. The first
twenty miles were tolerable, the last twenty
absolutely intolerable.&rsquo; After noting that
in Franklin &lsquo;religion had extensively prevailed,&rsquo;
he wrote:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Unadilla is becoming a very pretty
village. It is built on a delightful ground
along the Susquehanna and the number of
houses, particularly of good ones, has much
increased. A part of the country between
this and Oxford is cultivated; a considerable
part of it is still a wilderness. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
country is rough and of a high elevation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In some reminiscences<a name="FNanchor_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> which my father
wrote in 1890, he described the scenes
along this road that were familiar to him
in boyhood at Kortright&mdash;1825 to 1835.
The road was then in its most prosperous
period. It was not uncommon for one of
the hotels, which marked every few miles
of the route, to entertain thirty or forty
guests at a time. The freight wagons were
huge in size, drawn by six and eight
horses, and had wheels with wide tires.
Stages drawn by four and six horses were
continually in use. Not infrequently came
families bound for Ohio, where they expected
to settle&mdash;some of these Connecticut
people, who helped to plant the Western
Reserve settlements. This vast traffic
brought easy prosperity to the people along
the turnpike and built up towns and villages.
My father records the success of
the Rev. Mr. McAuley&rsquo;s church at Kortright&mdash;a
place that has now retrograded
so that it is only a small hamlet, just capa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>ble
of retaining a post office. But Mr.
McAuley&rsquo;s church at one time, more than
sixty years ago, had five hundred members,
and was said to be the largest church
society west of the Hudson valley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A change occurred with the digging of
the Erie Canal and the building of the Erie
Railway. Morever, in 1834 was built a
turnpike from North Kortright through the
Charlotte Valley to Oneonta. The white
man having tried a route of his own over
the hills, reverted to the route which the
red man had marked out for him ages
before. Much easier was the grade by this
river road, and this fact exercised a marked
influence on the fortunes of the settlements
along the olden line. Freight wagons
were drawn off and sent by the easier way.
Stages followed the new turnpike and the
country between Wattles&rsquo;s Ferry and Kortright
retrograded as rapidly as it had
formerly improved.<a name="FNanchor_46_47" id="FNanchor_46_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The building of the Catskill Turnpike
really led to the founding of Unadilla vil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>lage
on its present site. It had confined to
this point a growth which otherwise would
probably have been distributed among
other points along the valley. Here was a
stopping-place, with a river to be crossed,
horses to be changed, and new stages
taken, and here had been established the
important market for country produce of
Noble &amp; Hayes. Unadilla became what
might be called a small but thriving inland
river port. Here lumber was sawed and
here it came from mills elsewhere for shipment
along with farm products to Baltimore.
Here grain was ground, and here
were three prosperous distilleries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The building of the turnpike along the
Charlotte was not the only blow that came
to the western portion of the Catskill Road.
Another and permanent one came to the
whole length of the turnpike when the Erie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Canal was built, followed later by the Erie
Railroad. Otsego County, in 1832, had
reached a population of 52,370, but with
the Erie Canal in operation it ceased to
grow. At the present time the showing is
considerably less than it was in 1832, and
yet several villages have made large increases,
the increase in Oneonta being
probably tenfold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Contemporary with the Erie Canal
was an attempt to provide the Susquehanna
with a canal. It became a subject of vast
local interest from Cooperstown to the
interior of Pennsylvania. The scheme
included a railway, or some other method of
reaching the Erie Canal from the head of
Otsego Lake. Colonel De Witt Clinton,
Jr., son of the governor, made a survey as
far as Milford, and found that in nine miles
there was a fall of thirty feet, and that at
Unadilla the fall from the lake was 150
feet, while in 110 miles from the lake it
was 350 feet. In 1830 a new survey
showed that 144 miles out of 153 were
already navigable, the remaining distance
requiring a canal. Some seventy locks
would be needed and sixty-five dams.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Judge Page, while a member of Congress,
introduced a bill to aid slack-water navigation
from Cooperstown to tide-water. It
was his opinion that the failure of the bill
was due to the spread of railroads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the ushering in of the great railroad
era, the Susquehanna Valley saw
started as early as 1830 many railroad projects
which could save it from threatened
danger. Their aim was to connect the
upper Susquehanna with the Hudson at
Catskill, and the Mohawk at Canajoharie.
None ever got beyond the charter stage.
Strenuous efforts were afterward made to
bring the Erie from the ancient Cookoze
(Deposit) to the Susquehanna at a point
above Oghwaga, but this also failed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed it was not until after the Civil
War that any railroad reached the headwaters
of the Susquehanna; but it was an
agreeable sign of the enterprise which
attended the men of 1830 and following
years that at the period when
the earliest railroad in this State,
and one of the earliest on this continent,
had just been built from Albany to
Schenectady, serious projects existed for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
opening this valley to the outer world.
Even the great Erie project languished long
in consequence of business depression. It
was not until 1845 that it was completed as
far as Middletown, and not until 1851 that
it reached Dunkirk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even to the Erie was final supremacy
on this frontier assured, but the
upper Susquehanna lands, more than those
through which the Erie ran, were doomed to
a condition of isolation. Nature itself had
decreed that the great route of transportation
in New York State was to run where
the great trail of the Iroquois for centuries
had run&mdash;through the Mohawk Valley.
Along that central trail from Albany, &lsquo;the
Eastern Door,&rsquo; to Buffalo, &lsquo;the Western
door of the Long House,&rsquo; the course of
empire westward was to take its way.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>WITH DICKENS ALONG PIONEER ROADS</h3>


<p>Some of the most interesting descriptions
of pioneer traveling are from
the racy pages of Charles Dickens&rsquo;s
<i>American Notes</i>, a volume well known to
every reader. No description of early
traveling in America would be complete,
however, without including a number of
these extremely witty, and, in some instances,
extremely pathetic descriptions of
conditions that obtained in Virginia and
Ohio in Dickens&rsquo;s day. The following
description of a negro driver&rsquo;s manipulation
of reins, horses, and passengers may
be slightly exaggerated, but undoubtedly
presents a typical picture of southern stage
driving:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon after nine o&rsquo;clock we come to
Potomac Creek, where we are to land;
and then comes the oddest part of the
journey. Seven stage-coaches are preparing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
to carry us on. Some of them are ready,
some of them are not ready. Some of the
drivers are blacks, some whites. There
are four horses to each coach, and all the
horses, harnessed or unharnessed, are there.
The passengers are getting out of the
steamboat, and into the coaches, the luggage
is being transferred in noisy wheel-barrows;
the horses are frightened, and
impatient to start; the black drivers are
chattering to them like so many monkeys;
and the white ones whooping like so many
drovers: for the main thing to be done in
all kinds of hostlering here, is to make as
much noise as possible. The coaches are
something like the French coaches, but not
nearly so good. In lieu of springs, they
are hung on bands of the strongest leather.
There is very little choice or difference
between them; and they may be likened to
the car portion of the swings at an English
fair, roofed, put upon axle-trees and
wheels, and curtained with painted canvas.
They are covered with mud from the roof
to the wheel-tire, and have never been
cleaned since they were first built.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tickets we have received on board<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the steamboat are marked No. 1, so we
belong to coach No. 1. I throw my coat
on the box, and hoist my wife and her maid
into the inside. It has only one step, and
that being about a yard from the ground, is
usually approached by a chair: when there
is no chair, ladies trust in Providence.
The coach holds nine inside, having a seat
across from door to door, where we in England
put our legs: so that there is only one
feat more difficult in the performance than
getting in, and that is getting out again.
There is only one outside passenger, and
he sits upon the box. As I am that one, I
climb up; and while they are strapping
the luggage on the roof, and heaping it
into a kind of tray behind, have a good
opportunity of looking at the driver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a negro&mdash;very black indeed.
He is dressed in a coarse pepper-and-salt
suit excessively patched and darned (particularly
at the knees), grey stockings, enormous
unblacked high-low shoes, and very
short trousers. He has two odd gloves:
one of parti-coloured worsted, and one of
leather. He has a very short whip, broken
in the middle and bandaged up with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
string. And yet he wears a low-crowned,
broad-brimmed, block hat: faintly shadowing
forth a kind of insane imitation of an
English coachman! But somebody in
authority cries &lsquo;Go ahead!&rsquo; as I am making
these observations. The mail takes the
lead in a four-horse wagon, and all the
coaches follow in procession: headed by
No. 1.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, whenever an Englishman
would cry &lsquo;All right!&rsquo; an American cries
&lsquo;Go ahead!&rsquo; which is somewhat expressive
of the national character of the two countries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first half mile of the road is over
bridges made of loose planks laid across
two parallel poles, which tilt up as the
wheels roll over them: and <span class="smcap">in</span> the river.
The river has a clayey bottom and is full
of holes, so that half a horse is constantly
disappearing unexpectedly, and can&rsquo;t be
found again for some time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we get past even this, and come to
the road itself, which is a series of alternate
swamps and gravel-pits. A tremendous
place is close before us, the black driver
rolls his eyes, screws his mouth up very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
round, and looks straight between the two
leaders, as if he were saying to himself,
&lsquo;We have done this often before, but <i>now</i> I
think we shall have a crash.&rsquo; He takes a
rein in each hand; jerks and pulls at both;
and dances on the splashing board with
both feet (keeping his seat, of course) like
the late lamented Ducrow on two of his
fiery coursers. We come to the spot, sink
down in the mire nearly to the coach windows,
tilt on one side at an angle of forty-five
degrees, and stick there. The insides
scream dismally; the coach stops; the
horses flounder; all the other six coaches
stop; and their four-and-twenty horses
flounder likewise: but merely for company,
and in sympathy with ours. Then the
following circumstances occur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Black Driver</span> (to the horses). &lsquo;Hi!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nothing happens. Insides scream again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Driver</span> (to the horses). &lsquo;Ho!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Horses plunge, and splash the black
driver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman inside</span> (looking out). &lsquo;Why,
what on airth&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gentleman receives a variety of splashes
and draws his head in again, without finish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>ing
his question or waiting for an answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Driver</span> (still to the horses).
&lsquo;Jiddy! Jiddy!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Horses pull violently, drag the coach out
of the hole, and draw it up a bank; so
steep, that the black driver&rsquo;s legs fly up
into the air, and he goes back among the
luggage on the roof. But he immediately
recovers himself, and cries (still to the
horses),</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pill!&rsquo;</p>

<p>No effect. On the contrary, the coach
begins to roll back upon No. 2, which rolls
back upon No. 3, which rolls back upon No.
4, and so on, until No. 7 is heard to curse
and swear, nearly a quarter of a mile behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Driver</span> (louder than before).
&lsquo;Pill!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Horses make another struggle to get up
the bank, and again the coach rolls backward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Driver</span> (louder than before).
&lsquo;Pe-e-e-ill!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Horses make a desperate struggle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Driver</span> (recovering spirits). &lsquo;Hi!
Jiddy, Jiddy, Pill!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Horses make another effort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Driver</span> (with great vigour).
&lsquo;Ally Loo! Hi. Jiddy, Jiddy. Pill. Ally
Loo!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Horses almost do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Driver</span> (with his eyes starting
out of his head). &lsquo;Lee, dere. Lee, dere.
Hi. Jiddy, Jiddy. Pill. Ally Loo.
Lee-e-e-e-e!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They run up the bank, and go down
again on the other side at a fearful pace.
It is impossible to stop them, and at the
bottom there is a deep hollow, full of water.
The coach rolls frightfully. The insides
scream. The mud and water fly about us.
The black driver dances like a madman.
Suddenly we are all right by some extraordinary
means, and stop to breathe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A black friend of the black driver is
sitting on a fence. The black driver recognizes
him by twirling his head round and
round like a harlequin, rolling his eyes,
shrugging his shoulders, and grinning
from ear to ear. He stops short, turns to
me, and says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We shall get you through sa, like a
fiddle, and hope a please you when we get
you through sa. Old &rsquo;ooman at home sir:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>&rsquo;
chuckling very much. &lsquo;Outside gentleman
sa, he often remember old &rsquo;ooman at
home sa,&rsquo; grinning again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aye aye, we&rsquo;ll take care of the old
woman. Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The black driver grins again, but there
is another hole, and beyond that, another
bank, close before us. So he stops short:
cries (to the horses again) &lsquo;Easy. Easy
den. Ease. Steady. Hi. Jiddy. Pill.
Ally. Loo!&rsquo; but never &lsquo;Lee!&rsquo; until we
are reduced to the very last extremity, and
are in the midst of difficulties, extrication
from which appears to be all but impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so we do the ten miles or thereabouts
in two hours and a half; breaking
no bones though bruising a great many;
and in short getting through the distance,
&lsquo;like a fiddle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This singular kind of coaching terminates
at Fredericksburgh, whence there is
a railway to Richmond....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dickens, the student of human nature,
surely found vast material for inspection
and observation in our American coaches.
The drivers particularly attracted his attention
as we have seen; their philosophical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
indifference to those under their charge as
well as their anxieties on certain occasions
caused him to marvel. The stage-drivers
of Dickens&rsquo;s day were marvels and offer
character studies as unique as they were
interesting. For the general air of conscienceless
indifference on the part of
drivers, and exasperated verbosity of
passengers, perhaps no sketch of Dickens is
more to the point than the following which
describes, with lasting flavor, a ride from
York, Pennsylvania, to Harrisburg:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We left Baltimore by another railway
at half-past eight in the morning, and
reached the town of York, some sixty miles
off, by the early dinner-time of the Hotel
which was the starting-place of the four-horse
coach, wherein we were to proceed
to Harrisburg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This conveyance, the box of which I
was fortunate enough to secure, had come
down to meet us at the railroad station, and
was as muddy and cumbersome as usual.
As more passengers were waiting for us at
the inn-door, the coachman observed under
his breath, in the usual self-communicative
voice, looking the while at his mouldy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
harness, as if it were to that he was
addressing himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I expect we shall want <i>the big</i> coach.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not help wondering within
myself what the size of this big coach
might be, and how many persons it might
be designed to hold; for the vehicle which
was too small for our purpose was something
larger than two English heavy night
coaches, and might have been the twin-brother
of a French diligence. My speculations
were speedily set at rest, however,
for as soon as we had dined, there came
rumbling up the street, shaking its sides
like a corpulent giant, a kind of barge on
wheels. After much blundering and backing,
it stopped at the door: rolling heavily
from side to side when its other motion
had ceased, as if it had taken cold in its
damp stable, and between that, and the
having been required in its dropsical old
age to move at any faster pace than a walk,
were distressed by shortness of wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If here ain&rsquo;t the Harrisburg mail at
last, and dreadful bright and smart to look
at too,&rsquo; cried an elderly gentleman in some
excitement, &lsquo;darn my mother!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the sensation of
being darned may be, or whether a man&rsquo;s
mother has a keener relish or disrelish of
the process than anybody else; but if the
endurance of this mysterious ceremony by
the old lady in question had depended on
the accuracy of her son&rsquo;s vision in respect
to the abstract brightness and smartness of
the Harrisburg mail, she would certainly
have undergone its infliction. However,
they booked twelve people inside; and the
luggage (including such trifles as a large
rocking-chair, and a good-sized dining-table),
being at length made fast upon the
roof, we started off in great state.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the door of another hotel, there was
another passenger to be taken up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Any room, sir?&lsquo; cries the new passenger
to the coachman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well there&rsquo;s room enough,&rsquo; replies
the coachman, without getting down, or
even looking at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There an&rsquo;t no room at all, sir,&rsquo; bawls
a gentleman inside. Which another gentleman
(also inside) confirms, by predicting
that the attempt to introduce any more
passengers &lsquo;won&rsquo;t fit nohow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The new passenger, without any expression
of anxiety, looks into the coach,
and then looks up at the coachman: &lsquo;Now,
how do you mean to fix it?&rsquo; says he,
after a pause: &lsquo;for I <i>must</i> go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coachman employs himself in
twisting the lash of his whip into a knot,
and takes no more notice of the question:
clearly signifying that it is anybody&rsquo;s
business but his, and that the passengers
would do well to fix it, among themselves.
In this state of things, matters
seem to be approximating to a fix of
another kind, when another inside passenger
in a corner, who is nearly suffocated,
cries faintly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is no matter of relief or self-congratulation
to the driver, for his immoveable
philosophy is perfectly undisturbed by
anything that happens in the coach. Of
all things in the world, the coach would
seem to be the very last upon his mind.
The exchange is made, however, and then
the passenger who has given up his seat
makes a third upon the box, seating himself
in what he calls the middle: that is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
with half his person on my legs, and the
other half on the driver&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go a-head cap&rsquo;en,&rsquo; cries the colonel,
who directs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go-lang!&rsquo; cries the cap&rsquo;en to his
company, the horses, and away we go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We took up at a rural bar-room, after
we had gone a few miles, an intoxicated
gentleman who climbed upon the roof
among the luggage, and subsequently slipping
off without hurting himself, was seen
in the distant perspective reeling back to
the grog-shop where we had found him.
We also parted with more of our freight at
different times, so that when we came to
change horses, I was again alone outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coachmen always change with the
horses, and are usually as dirty as the
coach. The first was dressed like a very
shabby English baker; the second like a
Russian peasant; for he wore a loose purple
camlet robe with a fur collar, tied
round his waist with a parti-coloured
worsted sash; grey trousers; light blue
gloves; and a cap of bearskin. It had by
this time come on to rain very heavily, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
there was a cold damp mist besides, which
penetrated to the skin. I was very glad to
take advantage of a stoppage and get down
to stretch my legs, shake the water off my
great-coat, and swallow the usual anti-temperance
recipe for keeping out the
cold....</p>

<p>&ldquo;We crossed this river [Susquehanna]
by a wooden bridge, roofed and covered in
on all sides, and nearly a mile in length.
It was profoundly dark; perplexed, with
great beams, crossing and recrossing it at
every possible angle; and through the
broad chinks and crevices in the floor, the
rapid river gleamed, far down below, like
a legion of eyes. We had no lamps; and
as the horses stumbled and floundered
through this place, towards the distant
speck of dying light, it seemed interminable.
I really could not at first persuade
myself as we rumbled heavily on, filling
the bridge with hollow noises, and I held
down my head to save it from the rafters
above, but that I was in a painful dream;
for I have often dreamed of toiling through
such places, and as often argued, even at
the time, &lsquo;this cannot be reality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length, however, we emerged upon
the streets of Harrisburg....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coachmen are further described by Dickens
during his stagecoach trip from Cincinnati
to Columbus in Ohio:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We often stop to water at a roadside
inn, which is always dull and silent. The
coachman dismounts and fills his bucket,
and holds it to the horses&rsquo; heads. There
is scarcely any one to help him; there are
seldom any loungers standing round; and
never any stable-company with jokes to
crack. Sometimes, when we have changed
our team, there is a difficulty in starting
again, arising out of the prevalent mode of
breaking a young horse; which is to catch
him, harness him against his will, and put
him in a stage-coach without further notice:
but we get on somehow or other, after a
great many kicks and a violent struggle;
and jog on as before again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Occasionally, when we stop to change,
some two or three half-drunken loafers
will come loitering out with their hands in
their pockets, or will be seen kicking their
heels in rocking-chairs, or lounging on the
window sill, or sitting on a rail within the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
colonnade: they have not often anything to
say though, either to us or to each other,
but sit there idly staring at the coach and
horses. The landlord of the inn is usually
among them, and seems, of all the party,
to be the least connected with the business
of the house. Indeed he is with reference
to the tavern, what the driver is in relation
to the coach and passengers: whatever happens
in his sphere of action, he is quite
indifferent, and perfectly easy in his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The frequent change of coachmen
works no change or variety in the coachman&rsquo;s
character. He is always dirty,
sullen, and taciturn. If he be capable of
smartness of any kind, moral or physical,
he has a faculty of concealing it which is
truly marvellous. He never speaks to you
as you sit beside him on the box, and if
you speak to him, he answers (if at all) in
monosyllables. He points out nothing on
the road, and seldom looks at anything:
being, to all appearance, thoroughly weary
of it, and of existence generally. As to
doing the honours of his coach, his business,
as I have said, is with the horses.
The coach follows because it is attached to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
them and goes on wheels: not because you
are in it. Sometimes, towards the end of
a long stage, he suddenly breaks out into a
discordant fragment of an election song,
but his face never sings along with him:
it is only his voice, and not often that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He always chews and always spits, and
never encumbers himself with a pocket-handkerchief.
The consequences to the
box passenger, especially when the wind
blows toward him, are not agreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiring a special express coach at Columbus,
Dickens and his party went on to Sandusky
on Lake Erie alone. His description
of the rough, narrow corduroy road is
unequaled and no one but Dickens could
have penned such a thrilling picture of the
half-conquered woodland and its spectral
inhabitants:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There being no stage-coach next day,
upon the road we wished to take, I hired
&lsquo;an extra,&rsquo; at a reasonable charge, to carry
us to Tiffin, a small town from whence
there is a railroad to Sandusky. This extra
was an ordinary four-horse stage-coach,
such as I have described, changing horses
and drivers, as the stage-coach would, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
was exclusively our own for the journey.
To ensure our having horses at the proper
stations, and being incommoded by no
strangers, the proprietors sent an agent on
the box, who was to accompany us all the
way through; and thus attended, and bearing
with us, besides, a hamper full of
savoury cold meats, and fruit, and wine;
we started off again, in high spirits, at
half-past six o&rsquo;clock next morning, very
much delighted to be by ourselves, and
disposed to enjoy even the roughest
journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was well for us, that we were in this
humour, for the road we went over that
day, was certainly enough to have shaken
tempers that were not resolutely at Set
Fair, down to some inches below Stormy.
At one time we were all flung together in
a heap at the bottom of the coach, and at
another we were crushing our heads
against the roof. Now, one side was down
deep in the mire, and we were holding on
to the other. Now, the coach was lying on
the tails of the two wheelers; and now it
was rearing up in the air, in a frantic state,
with all four horses standing on the top of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
an insurmountable eminence, looking coolly
back at it, as though they would say &lsquo;Unharness
us. It can&rsquo;t be done.&rsquo; The
drivers on these roads, who certainly get
over the ground in a manner which is quite
miraculous, so twist and turn the team
about in forcing a passage, corkscrew fashion,
through the bogs and swamps, that it
was quite a common circumstance on looking
out of the window, to see the coachman
with the ends of a pair of reins in his
hands, apparently driving nothing, or playing
at horses, and the leaders staring at
one unexpectedly from the back of the
coach, as if they had some idea of getting
up behind. A great portion of the way
was over what is called a corduroy road,
which is made by throwing trunks of trees
into a marsh, and leaving them to settle
there. The very slightest of the jolts with
which the ponderous carriage fell from log
to log, was enough, it seemed, to have dislocated
all the bones in the human body.
It would be impossible to experience a
similar set of sensations, in any other circumstances,
unless perhaps in attempting
to go up to the top of St. Paul&rsquo;s in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
omnibus. Never, never once, that day,
was the coach in any position, attitude, or
kind of motion to which we are accustomed
in coaches. Never did it make the smallest
approach to one&rsquo;s experience of the
proceedings of any sort of vehicle that
goes on wheels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, it was a fine day, and the temperature
was delicious, and though we had
left Summer behind us in the west, and
were fast leaving Spring, we were moving
towards Niagara and home. We alighted
in a pleasant wood towards the middle of
the day, dined on a fallen tree, and leaving
our best fragments with a cottager, and
our worst with the pigs (who swarm in this
part of the country like grains of sand on
the sea-shore, to the great comfort of our
commissariat in Canada), we went forward
again, gaily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As night came on, the track grew narrower
and narrower, until at last it so lost
itself among the trees, that the driver
seemed to find his way by instinct. We
had the comfort of knowing, at least, that
there was no danger of his falling asleep,
for every now and then a wheel would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
strike against an unseen stump with such a
jerk, that he was fain to hold on pretty
tight and pretty quick to keep himself upon
the box. Nor was there any reason to dread
the least danger from furious driving, inasmuch
as over that broken ground the horses
had enough to do to walk; as to shying,
there was no room for that; and a herd of
wild elephants could not have run away in
such a wood, with such a coach at their heels.
So we stumbled along, quite satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These stumps of trees are a curious
feature in American travelling. The varying
illusions they present to the unaccustomed
eye as it grows dark, are quite
astonishing in their number and reality.
Now, there is a Grecian urn erected in the
centre of a lonely field; now there is a
woman weeping at a tomb; now a very
comonplace old gentleman in a white
waist-coat, with a thumb thrust into each
arm-hole of his coat; now a student poring
on a book; now a crouching negro; now, a
horse, a dog, a cannon, an armed man; a
hunch-back throwing off his cloak and stepping
forth into the light. They were often
as entertaining to me as so many glasses in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
a magic lantern, and never took their
shapes at my bidding, but seemed to force
themselves upon me, whether I would or
no; and strange to say, I sometimes
recognized in them counterparts of figures
once familiar to me in pictures attached to
childish books, forgotten long ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It soon became too dark, however, even
for this amusement, and the trees were so
close together that their dry branches rattled
against the coach on either side, and
obliged us all to keep our heads within. It
lightened too, for three whole hours; each
flash being very bright, and blue, and long;
and as the vivid streaks came darting in
among the crowded branches, and the
thunder rolled gloomily above the tree tops,
one could scarcely help thinking that there
were better neighbourhoods at such a time
than thick woods afforded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length, between ten and eleven
o&rsquo;clock at night, a few feeble lights appeared
in the distance, and Upper Sandusky,
an Indian village, where we were to
stay till morning, lay before us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dickens&rsquo;s description of his visit to
&ldquo;Looking-Glass Prairie&rdquo; from St. Louis is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
full of amusement, and contains many
vivid pictures of pioneer roads and taverns
in the Mississippi Valley:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I had a great desire to see a Prairie
before turning back from the furthest point
of my wanderings; and as some gentlemen
of the town had, in their hospitable consideration,
an equal desire to gratify me;
a day was fixed, before my departure, for an
expedition to the Looking-Glass Prairie,
which is within thirty miles of the town.
Deeming it possible that my readers may
not object to know what kind of thing such
a gipsy party may be at that distance from
home, and among what sort of objects it
moves, I will describe the jaunt....</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may premise that the word Prairie is
variously pronounced <i>paraaer</i>, <i>parearer</i>, and
<i>paroarer</i>. The latter mode of pronunciation
is perhaps the most in favour. We
were fourteen in all, and all young men:
indeed it is a singular though very natural
feature in the society of these distant settlements,
that it is mainly composed of adventurous
persons in the prime of life, and has
very few grey heads among it. There
were no ladies: the trip being a fatiguing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
one: and we were to start at five o&rsquo;clock
in the morning punctually....</p>

<p>&ldquo;At seven o&rsquo;clock ... the party
had assembled, and were gathered round
one light carriage, with a very stout axletree;
one something on wheels like an
amateur carrier&rsquo;s cart; one double phaeton
of great antiquity and unearthly construction;
one gig with a great hole in its back
and a broken head; and one rider on horseback
who was to go on before. I got into
the first coach with three companions; the
rest bestowed themselves in the other
vehicles; two large baskets were made fast
to the lightest; two large stone jars in
wicker cases, technically known as demi-johns,
were consigned to the &lsquo;least rowdy&rsquo;
of the party for safe keeping; and the procession
moved off to the ferry-boat, in
which it was to cross the river bodily,
men, horses, carriages, and all as the manner
in these parts is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We got over the river in due course,
and mustered again before a little wooden
box on wheels, hove down all aslant in a
morass, with &lsquo;<span class="smcap">merchant tailor</span>&rsquo;  painted
in very large letters over the door. Hav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>ing
settled the order of proceeding, and the
road to be taken, we started off once more
and began to make our way through an
ill-favoured Black Hollow, called, less
expressively, the American Bottom....</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had a pair of very strong horses,
but travelled at the rate of little more than
a couple of miles an hour, through one
unbroken slough of black mud and water.
It had no variety but in depth. Now it
was only half over the wheels, now it hid
the axletree, and now the coach sank down
in it almost to the windows. The air resounded
in all directions with the loud
chirping of the frogs, who, with the pigs
(a coarse, ugly breed, as unwholesome-looking
as though they were the spontaneous
growth of the country), had the whole
scene to themselves. Here and there we
passed a log hut; but the wretched cabins
were wide apart and thinly scattered, for
though the soil is very rich in this place,
few people can exist in such a deadly
atmosphere. On either side of the track,
if it deserve the name, was the thick
&lsquo;bush;&rsquo; and everywhere was stagnant,
slimy, rotten, filthy water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As it is the custom in these parts to
give a horse a gallon or so of cold water
whenever he is in a foam with heat, we
halted for that purpose, at a log inn in the
wood, far removed from any other residence.
It consisted of one room, bare-roofed
and bare-walled of course, with a
loft above. The ministering priest was a
swarthy young savage, in a shirt of cotton
print like bed-furniture, and a pair of
ragged trousers. There were a couple of
young boys, too, nearly naked, lying idly
by the well; and they, and he, and <i>the</i>
traveller at the inn, turned out to look
at us....</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the horses were swollen out to
about twice their natural dimensions (there
seems to be an idea here, that this kind of
inflation improves their going), we went
forward again, through mud and mire, and
damp, and festering heat, and brake and
bush, attended always by the music of the
frogs and pigs, until nearly noon, when we
halted at a place called Belleville.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Belleville was a small collection of
wooden houses, huddled together in the
very heart of the bush and swamp....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
The criminal court was sitting, and was
at that moment trying some criminals for
horse-stealing; with whom it would most
likely go hard: for live stock of all kinds
being necessarily very much exposed in
the woods, is held by the community in
rather higher value than human life; and
for this reason, juries generally make a
point of finding all men indicted for cattle-stealing,
guilty, whether or no. The
horses belonging to the bar, the judge, and
witnesses, were tied to temporary racks set
up roughly in the road; by which is to be
understood, a forest path, nearly knee-deep
in mud and slime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was an hotel in this place which,
like all hotels in America, had its large
dining-room for the public table. It was an
odd, shambling, low-roofed out-house, half
cowshed and half kitchen, with a coarse
brown canvas table-cloth, and tin sconces
stuck against the walls, to hold candles at
supper-time. The horseman had gone forward
to have coffee and some eatables
prepared, and they were by this time
nearly ready. He had ordered &lsquo;wheat-bread
and chicken fixings,&rsquo; in preference to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
&lsquo;corn-bread and common doings.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_47_48" id="FNanchor_47_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_48" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The latter
kind of refection includes only pork and
bacon. The former comprehends broiled
ham, sausages, veal cutlets, steaks, and
such other viands of that nature as may be
supposed, by a tolerably wide poetical construction,
&lsquo;to fix&rsquo; a chicken comfortably
in the digestive organs of any lady or gentleman....</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Belleville, we went on, through
the same desolate kind of waste, and constantly
attended, without the interval of a
moment, by the same music; until, at
three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, we halted
once more at a village called Lebanon to
inflate the horses again, and give them
some corn besides: of which they stood
much in need. Pending this ceremony, I
walked into the village, where I met a full
sized dwelling-house coming down-hill at
a round trot, drawn by a score or more of
oxen. The public-house was so very clean
and good a one, that the managers of the
jaunt resolved to return to it and put up
there for the night, if possible. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
course decided on, and the horses being
well refreshed, we again pushed forward,
and came upon the Prairie at sunset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be difficult to say why, or
how&mdash;though it was possibly from having
heard and read so much about it&mdash;but the
effect on me was disappointment. Looking
towards the setting sun, there lay,
stretched out before my view, a vast expanse
of level ground; unbroken, save by
one thin line of trees, which scarcely
amounted to a scratch upon the great
blank; until it met the glowing sky,
wherein it seemed to dip: mingling with
its rich colours, and mellowing in its distant
blue. There it lay, a tranquil sea or
lake without water, if such a simile be
admissible, with the day going down
upon it; a few birds wheeling here and
there; and solitude and silence reigning
paramount around. But the grass was not
yet high; there were bare black patches on
the ground; and the few wild flowers that
the eye could see, were poor and scanty.
Great as the picture was, its very flatness
and extent, which left nothing to the
imagination, tamed it down and cramped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
its interest. I felt little of that sense of
freedom and exhilaration which a Scottish
heath inspires, or even our English downs
awaken. It was lonely and wild, but oppressive
in its barren monotony. I felt
that in traversing the Prairies, I could
never abandon myself to the scene, forgetful
of all else; as I should do instinctively,
were the heather underneath my feet, or an
iron-bound coast beyond; but should often
glance towards the distant and frequently-receding
line of the horizon, and wish it
gained and passed. It is not a scene to be
forgotten, but it is scarcely one, I think
(at all events, as I saw it), to remember with
much pleasure, or to covet the looking-on
again, in after life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We encamped near a solitary log-house,
for the sake of its water, and dined upon
the plain. The baskets contained roast
fowls, buffalo&rsquo;s tongue (an exquisite dainty,
by the way), ham, bread, cheese, and butter;
biscuits, champagne, sherry; lemons
and sugar for punch; and abundance of
rough ice. The meal was delicious, and
the entertainers were the soul of kindness
and good humour. I have often recalled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
that cheerful party to my pleasant recollection
since, and shall not easily forget, in
junketings nearer home with friends of
older date, my boon companions on the
Prairie. Returning to Lebanon that night,
we lay at the little inn at which we had
halted in the afternoon. In point of cleanliness
and comfort it would have suffered
by no comparison with any village ale-house,
of a homely kind, in England....</p>

<p>&ldquo;After breakfast, we started to return
by a different way from that which we had
taken yesterday, and coming up at ten
o&rsquo;clock with an encampment of German
emigrants carrying their goods in carts,
who had made a rousing fire which they
were just quitting, we stopped there to
refresh. And very pleasant the fire was;
for, hot though it had been yesterday, it
was quite cold to-day, and the wind blew
keenly. Looming in the distance, as we
rode along, was another of the ancient Indian
burial-places, called The Monks&rsquo;
Mound; in memory of a body of fanatics of
the order of La Trappe, who founded a
desolate convent there, many years ago,
when there were no settlers within a thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>sand
miles, and were all swept off by the
pernicious climate: in which lamentable
fatality, few rational people will suppose,
perhaps, that society experienced any very
severe deprivation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The track of to-day had the same features
as the track of yesterday. There
was the swamp, the bush, the perpetual
chorus of frogs, the rank unseemly growth,
the unwholesome steaming earth. Here
and there, and frequently too, we encountered
a solitary broken-down waggon, full
of some new settler&rsquo;s goods. It was a
pitiful sight to see one of these vehicles
deep in the mire; the axletree broken; the
wheel lying idly by its side; the man gone
miles away, to look for assistance; the
woman seated among their wandering
household gods with a baby at her breast,
a picture of forlorn, dejected patience; the
team of oxen crouching down mournfully
in the mud, and breathing forth such clouds
of vapour from their mouths and nostrils,
that all the damp mist and fog around
seemed to have come direct from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In due time we mustered once again
before the merchant tailor&rsquo;s, and having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
done so, crossed over to the city in the
ferry-boat: passing, on the way, a spot
called Bloody Island, the duelling-ground
of St. Louis, and so designated in honour
of the last fatal combat fought there, which
was with pistols, breast to breast. Both
combatants fell dead upon the ground; and
possibly some rational people may think
of them, as of the gloomy madmen on the
Monks&rsquo; Mound, that they were no great
loss to the community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For purposes of comparison, the following
description of experiences in later
times with Indian trails of the West will be
of interest. Much that has been deduced
from a study of our pioneer history and
embodied in the preceding pages finds
strong confirmation here; in earlier days,
with forests covering the country, the trails
were more like roads than in the open
prairies of the West; but, as will be seen,
many laws governed the earlier and the
later Indian thoroughfares, alike. I quote
from the Hon. Charles Augustus Murray&rsquo;s
memoirs, written three-quarters of a century
ago, of a tour in Missouri:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 18th we pursued our course,
north by east: this was not exactly the
direction in which I wished to travel, but
two considerations induced me to adopt it
at this part of the journey. In the first
place, it enabled me to keep along the
dividing ridge; an advantage so great, and
so well understood by all prairie travellers,
that it is worth making a circuit of several
miles a day to keep it; and the Indian
trails which we have crossed since our
residence in the wilderness, convince me
that the savages pay the greatest attention
to this matter. In a wide extent of country
composed of a succession of hills and
ridges, it is evident there must be a great
number of steep banks, which offer to an
inexperienced traveller numerous obstacles,
rendering his own progress most toilsome,
and that of loaded packhorses almost
impossible. If these ridges all ran in
parallel lines, and were regular in their
formation, nothing would be more simple
than to get upon the summit of one, and
keep it for the whole day&rsquo;s journey: but
such is not the case; they constantly meet
other ridges running in a transverse direc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>tion;
and, of course, large dips and ravines
are consequent upon that meeting. The
&lsquo;dividing ridge&rsquo; of a district is that which,
while it is, as it were, the back-bone of the
range of which it forms a part, heads at
the same time all the transverse ravines,
whether on the right or on the left hand,
and thereby spares to the traveller an
infinity of toilsome ascent and descent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sometimes observed that an
Indian trail wound through a country in a
course perfectly serpentine, and appeared
to me to travel three miles when only one
was necessary. It was not till my own
practical experience had made me attend
more closely to this matter, that I learnt to
appreciate its importance. I think that
the first quality in a guide through an
unknown range of rolling prairie, is having
a good and a quick eye for hitting off the
&lsquo;dividing ridge;&rsquo; the second, perhaps, in
a western wilderness, is a ready and almost
intuitive perception (so often found in an
Indian) of the general character of a country,
so as to be able to bring his party to
water when it is very scarce....</p>

<p>A few miles farther we crossed an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Indian trail I think it was of a Pawnee
party, for it bore north by west ... it
had not been a war-party, as was evident
from the character of the trail. A war-party
leaves only the trail of the horses, or,
of course, if it be a foot party, the still
slighter tracks of their own feet; but when
they are on their summer hunt, or migrating
from one region to another, they take
their squaws and children with them, and
this trail can always be distinguished from
the former, by two parallel tracks about
three and a half feet apart, not unlike
those of a light pair of wheels: these are
made by the points of the long curved
poles on which their lodges are stretched,
the thickest or butt ends of which are
fastened to each side of the pack-saddle,
while the points trail behind the horse; in
crossing rough or boggy places, this is
often found the most inconvenient part of
an Indian camp equipage.... I was
fortunate enough to find an Indian trail
bearing north by east, which was as near
to our destined course as these odious
creeks would permit us to go. We struck
into it, and it brought us safely, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
not without difficulty, through the tangled
and muddy bottom in which we had been
involved: sometimes a horse floundered,
and more than once a pack came off; but
upon the whole we had great reason to
congratulate ourselves upon having found
this trail, by which we escaped in two
hours from a place which would, without
its assistance, probably have detained us
two days. I was by no means anxious to
part with so good a friend, and proceeded
some miles upon this same trail; it was
very old and indistinct, especially in the
high and dry parts of the prairie. I left
my horse with the rest of the party and
went on foot, in order that I might more
easily follow the trail, which became almost
imperceptible as we reached an elevated
district of table-land, which had been
burned so close that I very often lost the
track altogether for fifty yards. If a fire
takes place on a prairie where there is
already a distinct trail, it is as easy to follow
it, if not more so than before; because
the short and beaten grass offering no food
to the fire, partly escapes its fury, and
remains a green line upon a sea of black;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
but if the party making the trail pass
over a prairie which is already burnt, in
the succeeding season when the new grass
has grown, it can scarcely be traced by any
eye but that of an Indian.... After
we had travelled five hours ... I
found that the trail which we had been
following, merged in another and a larger
one, which appeared to run a point to the
west of north. This was so far out of our
course that I hesitated whether I should
not leave it altogether; but, upon reflection,
I determined not to do so ... if
I attempted to cross the country farther to
the eastward, without any trail, I should
meet with serious difficulties and delays....
I therefore struck into it,
and ere long the result justified my conjecture;
for we came to a wooded bottom
or valley, which was such a complete jungle,
and so extensive, that I am sure, if we
had not been guided by the trail, we could
not have made our way through it in a
week. As it was, the task was no easy
one; for the trail, though originally large,
was not very fresh, and the weeds and
branches had in many places so overgrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
it, that I was obliged to dismount and
trace it out on foot. It wound about with
a hundred serpentine evolutions to avoid
the heavy swamps and marshes around us;
and I repeatedly thought that, if we lost
it, we never should extricate our baggage:
even with its assistance, we were obliged
frequently to halt and replace the packs,
which were violently forced off by the
branches with which they constantly came
in contact ... &lsquo;where on earth is he
taking us now?&mdash;why we are going back
in the same direction as we came!&rsquo; I
turned round and asked the speaker (a
comrade) ... to point with his finger
to the quarter which he would make for if
he were guiding the party to Fort Leavenworth.
He did so; and I took out my
compass and showed him that he was
pointing south-west, <i>i.e.</i> to Santa F&eacute; and
the Gulf of California: so completely had
the poor fellow&rsquo;s head become puzzled by
the winding circuit we had made in the
swamp.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_48_49" id="FNanchor_48_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

an explanation of this interesting obituary; &ldquo;broadaggs&rdquo;
is, clearly, a corruption of &ldquo;Braddock&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Of
&ldquo;atherwayes&rdquo; no information is at hand; it was
probably the name of a woodsman who settled here&mdash;for
&ldquo;bear camplain&rdquo; undoubtedly means a &ldquo;bare
<i>campagne</i>,&rdquo; or clearing. The word <i>campagne</i> was a
common one among American pioneers. Cf. Harris&rsquo;s
<i>Tour</i>, p. 60. A spot halfway between Cumberland
and Uniontown would be very near the point where
the road crossed the Pennsylvania state-line.</p></div>
